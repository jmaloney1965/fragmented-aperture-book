## Notes on Submission

### IEEE Submission Process:
1. **Check IEEE Copyright Form**: https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/permissions-form.html
2. **May need to use official form** rather than email
3. **Typical timeline**: 2-4 weeks for response
4. **Academic use**: Often granted free or with minimal fee
5. **Commercial use**: May have higher fees

### Alternative for GTRI Authors:
After IEEE requests are sent, consider contacting:
- **D. W. Landgren** (landgren@gtri.gatech.edu or similar)
- **D. J. P. Dykes**
- **C. T. Howard**
- **K. R. Cook**

Approach as former colleagues rather than through GTRI legal. Many academics are sympathetic to book projects and may grant personal permission for figures from papers they authored.

### Priority Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Send Ellgardt, Thors, Barani requests to IEEE
- **Week 2**: Send Wright, follow up on others
- **Week 3**: Consider author direct contact for GTRI papers
- **Week 4-6**: Follow up, start receiving responses
