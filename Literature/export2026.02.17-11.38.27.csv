However, the available spaces are segmented into fragmented pieces by the electronic components inside the terminal. This article addresses the problem of how to utilize these fragmented spaces efficiently. A novel miniaturized wideband antenna strategy called distributed mobile antennas is proposed and the distributed two-element antennas are introduced. By assigning a 90° phase difference, the reflections looking toward these two antennas are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, leading to reflection cancellation. Therefore, wideband matching can be achieved and the bandwidth can be further improved by introducing the degree of freedom of the element size consistency. When the proposed strategy is applied to a normal patch, the measured results show that the impedance bandwidths are improved by  $3.6\times $  and  $4.6\times $  for the identical and dissimilar patch cases, respectively. When applied to a miniaturized patch, the bandwidths are improved by  $6.0\times $  and  $6.9\times $ . Moreover, due to the dispersion of hotspots by distributed two-element antennas, the specific absorption rate (SAR) achieves great average reductions of 1.4–2.4 dB. The proposed wideband strategy has great potential for applications in modern 5G mobile terminals.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3433530","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101427,U22BB2016); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3900102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10618984","Distributed mobile antennas;low-profile antennas;miniaturized antennas;wideband antennas","Antenna arrays;Mobile antennas;Antennas;Impedance;Broadband antennas;Reflection;Reflector antennas","","15","","49","IEEE","31 Jul 2024","Sept. 2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed fragmented antenna system is intended for a swarm of small unmanned aerial vehicles in a linear flight formation. Inductively end-loaded folded dipole antennas are used as radiating elements. The small antennas are designed so that they can individually radiate with small bandwidth when isolated. The overall dimensions and the total mass of these fabricated elements are  $12 \times 10\times 10$  cm ( $0.096\lambda _{0}\times 0.08\lambda _{0}\times 0.08\lambda _{0}$  at 240 MHz) and 18 g (including the matching network), respectively. Each miniaturized antenna can only provide 2.4 MHz (~1%) bandwidth and  $25~\Omega $  input impedance. Having proper electromagnetic coupling between a cluster of three of such elements, measurement results demonstrate that the middle element can provide 18.4 MHz bandwidth (7.7%, 7.7 fold improvement) and  $126~\Omega $  input impedance when the other two elements are loaded with optimal reactive elements. Moreover, the proposed configuration shows 1 dB gain improvement at boresight direction. The effects of flight formation fluctuations on the coupled antennas are also investigated, and it is shown that as the separation distance between the coupled antennas increases, the input impedance and bandwidth enhancement decrease. To overcome this problem, a tunable matching circuit containing a single varactor is proposed. Measurement results are shown to be in good agreement with the simulation predictions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2806397","U.S. Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-12-R-0012-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292882","Antenna miniaturization;bandwidth enhancement;coupled antenna array;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted antenna","Dipole antennas;Bandwidth;Couplings;Impedance;Loaded antennas;Antenna arrays","","10","","28","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","April 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The unit cell design consists of a printed circuit board (PCB) stack-up with a driven aperture layer that is DC connected with a single metal pin to a fragmented combiner layer. This single connection indicates that the antenna is unbalanced and therefore no balun or differential amplifier is required. Additionally, there are no vias required for this unbalanced array, allowing for this concept to be easily scaled to lower or higher frequencies. Further, the fragmented combiner is a PCB-based component, which eliminates the need for traditional commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components e.g. Wilkinson chips for this specific application.

This is the aim of this work, i.e., to develop a microwave device capable of inspecting foodstuffs, directly on the production line. The solution proposed for this work is a microwave imaging system that detects fragments in homogenous food packaged in circular plastic/glass jars. The system relies on a particular Antipodal Vivaldi antenna which, due to its ultra-wideband characteristics, can carry out the detection of various types of food, thus avoiding the need to use multiple antennas working at different frequencies to inspect foods with different characteristics.

For some specific UHF near-field RFID applications, given radiation pattern characteristics are expected. A fragment-type wire structure is quite suitable for these demands because uniform magnetic field distribution and given patterns could be generated through optimizing the fragmented wires in a designated electrically large area to obtain corresponding current distribution. In this article, the concept of a fragment-type structure as well as some design guidelines are reviewed and summarized.

Our findings reveal that smaller pixel sizes enhance the gain of large antennas, while asymmetrical designs offer advantages over symmetrical configurations.","2325-0364","979-8-3503-0735-1","10.1109/EMCEurope59828.2024.10722213","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10722213","Antennas;Genetic algorithm;Particle swarm optimization;Evolutionary computation;Fragmented","Image quality;Antenna measurements;Design methodology;Adaptive arrays;Directive antennas;Electromagnetic compatibility;Size measurement;Antennas;Optimization;Genetic algorithms","","","","21","IEEE","25 Oct 2024","2-5 Sept. 2024","2-5 Sept. 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These results were performed in the “Radio and Electronic Department” of the Novosibirsk State Technical University. As would be described, the band-pass filter incorporated into radio frequency assembly of the identical radiators (in other words: into the phased array antennas), opens up a potential opportunity to reduce the mutual coupling and widen the scan range in terms of the blindness and suppression of the quasi-transverse electromagnetic mode along the E-plane in the linear dipole-like phased arrays. To understand better, the nontraditional dipole-like radiator is described in details. Its three-dimensional architecture contains the novel re-entrant two-way power divider that is based on the metallic fragment like the hollow pipe with rectangular cross-section.

The inversion problem is solved by means of linearization, assuming the viability of the Born approximation thanks to the localized intrusions, and regularization, based on the singular value decomposition of the discretized scattering operator. Furthermore, an algorithm, to balance the illumination of the considered scenario due to the nonuniform radiation of the employed antennas, is presented to enhance imaging.

The practical implementation of special directional patterns based on aperture and, in particular, mirror antennas entails transforming the mirror profile, which can result in extremely complex configurations. At the same time, in a mirror antenna with a comb reflector, making a special directional pattern requires the correct choice of the groove depths that are short-circuited slits by the form and are periodically placed in the conducting screen. To synthesize a cosecant directional pattern based on an antenna with a comb reflector, the authoring computational algorithm is applied. The algorithm includes the interpolation of the amplitude-phase front of the electromagnetic wave produced by the antenna feed by the locally flat fragments and the use of a strict solution to the problem of screen slit diffraction of a plane wave with a bounded front in space. To determine the groove depths, a genetic algorithm and a criterion for the minimum standard deviation of the calculated directional pattern from the expected one are used. The results of the synthesis of a cosecant directional pattern in a wide angular sector based on an antenna with an optimized comb reflector are presented.","","978-1-6654-1345-9","10.1109/ICFSP53514.2021.9646425","RFBR; CNRS(grant numbers:20-51-15001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646425","mirror antenna;comb reflector;cosecant directional pattern;synthesis;computational algorithm;wave diffraction","Interpolation;Diffraction;Shape;Signal processing algorithms;Directive antennas;Signal processing;Reflector antennas","","1","","11","IEEE","23 Dec 2021","9-11 Sept. 2021","9-11 Sept. 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These characteristics are achieved using transversally asymmetric anisotropic unit cells that are subdivided into smaller fragments along the cross-polarization direction. The proposed unit cell possesses an asymmetric structure to suppress the open stopband and results in stable cross-polarized surface impedance while the copolarized impedance changes. Consequently, the hologram pattern operates as an unmodulated impedance surface in cross polarization, effectively reducing cross-polarized radiation. Additionally, the hologram pattern is optimized to suppress the open-stopband phenomenon, causing a consistent gain in the broadside direction. We employed a distributed model to analyze the surface impedance characteristics of the proposed unit cell. The simulated and measured results are in good agreement, validating our proposed antenna design. The proposed antenna continuously scans the beam from −24° to +38° through the broadside, with a broadside gain of 13.8 dBi and gain variation of less than 3 dB within the operating frequency band of 22.2–27.0 GHz.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2023.3324031","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea government(grant numbers:NRF-2022R1F1A1069725); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10283895","Anisotropic unit cell;frequency scanning;holographic antenna (HA);low cross polarization;open-stopband (OSB) suppression","Impedance;Surface impedance;Gain;Surface waves;Reflection;Degradation;Anisotropic;Holography;Polarization","","1","","32","IEEE","12 Oct 2023","Jan. 2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previously, we reported an adaptive nonlinear visualization system based on a complex-valued self-organizing map (CSOM) that deals with complex amplitude texture in reflection images at multiple frequencies. The system distinguishes landmines from clutter by paying attention to textural features obtained by high spatial resolution and wideband reflection measurement. Because the system employed a mechanical scan of a pair of horn antennas, the measurement required a long time. An array antenna can reduce the time. The antenna element to be used there should therefore be compact and wideband. This paper reports the design and fabrication of a walled LTSA array visualization system. The antenna element has a 14 times 28 mm aperture size, and works at the 8-12 GHz frequency band. Because the structure is a simple combination of glass epoxy substrates and metal plates, we can easily fabricate low-cost and lightweight arrays. Electrical switches realize a high-speed scanning of 12 times 12 = 144 elements in total. We also report the results of a visualization experiment, in which plastic landmines are clearly visualized with the array in combination with the adaptive CSOM processing. Detection of landmines at frequencies of 10 GHz is only likely to be possible for targets buried a few centimeter deep or where the soil attenuation is very low. This might be a severe limitation of applicability of the method, as in field conditions soil attenuations of 10 dB or considerably more are commonly encountered, requiring the radar to operate at frequencies below 2-3 GHz. The best solution may be a multisensor system comprising these complementary high- and low-frequency radars.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.897418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276893","Complex-valued self-organizing map (CSOM);ground-penetrating radar (GPR);linearly tapered slot antenna (LTSA);plastic landmine","Phased arrays;Spatial resolution;High-resolution imaging;Visualization;Plastics;Landmine detection;Frequency;Linear antenna arrays;Optical reflection;Antenna measurements","","47","","22","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, this work aims to numerically assess this principle of detection to water-based products that are, due to the medium losses, a challenging category at microwaves. An antennas array surrounds the object moving along the production line, to monitor the electromagnetic signal variations with respect to a reference case. The working frequency is chosen by selecting a proper trade-off between penetration depth and image resolution. Then, a procedure, based on the application of the distorted-Born approximation is applied to reconstruct a 3- D image of the contaminant position.

The proposed LoRa communication system comprises a LoRa sensor node board and an IoT-LoRa gateway board. The LoRa sensor node board is used to capture microplastic images using a digital camera and collect analog signal data from an  $8\times 8$  photodiode array which detects the reflected light from microplastic fragments. The data are transmitted using a LoRa elliptical patch antenna in the sensor node board, operating at 0.915 GHz for long-range data transfer. The IoT-LoRa gateway board is used to forward data received from the LoRa sensor node board to a cloud server via the internet, and the stored data are accessible and viewable via a smartphone. In this research, the antenna design is optimized by using machine learning (ML) algorithms, unlike conventional antenna design methods which rely on the manual and iterative process. The ML-optimized dual-band LoRa elliptical patch antenna covers the LoRa, UHF RFID, and ZigBee frequency bands, with an omnidirectional radiation pattern. The measured impedance bandwidths (IBWs) are 8.93% (0.868–0.949 GHz) and 12.69% (2.36–2.68 GHz) for the lower and upper frequency bands, respectively, with the corresponding impedance matching ( $\vert S_{\mathbf {11}} \vert $ ) of –23.02 dB at 0.907 GHz and −27.27 dB at 2.52 GHz. Two ML-optimized LoRa elliptical patch antennas are subsequently integrated into the LoRa communication system, that is, one on the LoRa sensor node board and other on the IoT-LoRa gateway board. Furthermore, prior to indoor and outdoor experiments, the ML-driven waterborne microplastic detection scheme with the LoRa communication system is trained and tested using camera-captured images and analog signal-converted images from the photodiode array. The ML-driven microplastic detection scheme can classify different types of microplastics in water, achieving an accuracy of 100% for all types of microplastics. The detection scheme is also capable of identifying the presence of microplastics in water, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.5%.

Unlike other concepts that use scale invariance to utilize a specific region of the aperture that changes with frequency (known as the active region), the FA is designed to utilize the entire aperture over the entire frequency band. The result is that FA antennas routinely approach the theoretical limit of antenna performance based on a uniformly illuminated aperture. However, because FAs consist of complex printed metallic patterns on single or multi layer substrates, the design necessarily is heavily simulation driven. Our proprietary design processes have been very successful in designing apertures for a wide variety of applications. The metallic pattern is described using a binary code (typically hundreds of bits), and the pattern is designed using a genetic algorithm on a large computer cluster. Because the design space for these antennas is enormous, it is unclear if a well-designed “good” antenna is near the best possible antenna. An additional question is whether or not our genetic search algorithms are efficiently searching the design space. To address these questions, over a decade ago GTRI researchers created a very limited antenna design that could be described using only 18 bits. Every possible antenna in this space was evaluated and algorithm convergence was proven. In the last decade, computers have been much more powerful, and our design process has evolved to allow much more complicated patterns. To update the previous results, ACL researchers recently used a large computer cluster to evaluate every possible antenna in a 24-bit design (2^24 possible antennas, which is 64 times larger than the previous dataset). The evaluation took nearly a month of cluster time and produced gigabytes of simulation results. Using this library of known solutions, we can quickly test design algorithms for convergence time. The encoding strategy is shown below. Bits 1–23 specify on/off regions of metal. The 24th bit specifies a choice of two feed regions (compare the cells marked 24 below). Detailed results based on this dataset will be presented at the conference.","","978-1-4799-1129-5","10.1109/USNC-URSI.2013.6715421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6715421","","Aperture antennas;Genetic algorithms;Computers;Clustering algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis","","2","","","IEEE","20 Jan 2014","7-13 July 2013","7-13 July 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The constant increase of mechanized process chain, the variety of materials employed during the production and the growing consumer awareness about food quality arose the number of complaints in the recent years. Several technologies are applied to ensure that products are free from contaminations, but they may fail in detecting low-density plastic or glass fragments contaminants accidentally present inside food/beverage products. To address this issue, a system exploiting microwave imaging is proposed and assessed in this work. To this end, we designed a system which is capable of monitoring of packaged food along the production line, taking into account the specific and challenging constraints arising in such a scenario.

The Doppler shift in signals reflected from space debris causes a temporary offset of the response at the output of the receiving part. That makes systematic error that is necessary to compensate for more accurate measurement. Furthermore, for space debris radar detection and subsequent coordinates and velocities determination there is a need to ensure an adequate signal storage time that also determines the required energy characteristics. For this, the flight time of space debris objects was calculated.

The implication is that in a reflectarray of such elements each element will see an electromagnetic environment that more closely emulates the infinite periodic one used to compute the element properties. We show experimentally that this indeed results in aperture efficiencies closely approaching the upper bounds achievable for some selected feed system, and offers a significant improvement over that obtained with conventional reflectarrays (that is, those not using similarity-synthesized fragmented elements). It is also shown that a reflectarray surface that uses fragmented elements can be simultaneously patterned with a visual image while still closely maintaining the desired reflection phase from its surface to yield a high-gain antenna.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2014.2330578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832513","Aperture efficiency;fragmented similarity-optimized reflectarray elements;mosaic reflectarray;sub-wavelength elements","Reflection;Shape;Finite element analysis;Apertures;Surface impedance;Optimization;Databases","","28","","40","IEEE","12 Jun 2014","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventionally, network dimensioning is done based on busy hour traffic leading to cost-intensive over-dimensioning for most of the time via deploying additional macro and small cells. In AAS, however, varying traffic concentrations can be flexibly handled by dynamic cell densification, e.g. by splitting a sector into smaller “sub-sectors”. Vertical sectorization is a well-known approach where a conventional sector is split vertically in to two, inner and outer sectors, resulting in 3×2 sectors per site for AAS-based tri-sectorized site. In this paper work, an alternative vertical sectorization deployment configuration is presented where the inner sectors build a so called super-cell resulting from transmitting the same cell information in all inner sectors. Investigation results show that the super-cell configuration can mitigate unwanted back and side lobe effects in close proximity of the site and, therefore, provides a significant gain for users in this coverage area.","1938-1883","978-1-4799-2003-7","10.1109/ICC.2014.6884129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6884129","Active Antenna Systems;Vertical Sectorization;Super-cell;Mobility","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Antenna radiation patterns;Standards;Wireless communication;Throughput","","3","","11","IEEE","28 Aug 2014","10-14 June 2014","10-14 June 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, airborne surveys face issues which can lead to reduced data quality and making subsurface imaging challenging. This study examines the effects of subsurface roughness and antenna elevation on bedrock identification using synthetic GPR data. Synthetic surfaces with increasing roughness levels were generated and used as the bedrock of a synthetic glacier, to be modelled in gprMax for 2D and 3D GPR simulations. Surveys were simulated at elevations of 0 m, 2 m, 5 m, and 13 m to mimic both ground-based and airborne acquisitions. Results reveal that greater surface roughness fragments subsurface reflections, especially at lower elevations where focused radiation patterns heighten sensitivity to irregularities. As antenna elevation increases, a reduced angular coverage highly reduce lateral data resolution, obscuring bedrock details and increasing interpretation challenges. Even though the ground-based surveys provide better quality data, both 2D and 3D surveys failed to reach the goal of imaging the subsurface irregularities. The results highlight the importance of balancing the trade-offs between data quality, survey efficiency, and logistical constraints, with an emphasis on selecting optimal acquisition parameters and processing algorithms based on the specific objectives of the study and the expected subsurface conditions.","2687-7899","979-8-3315-2335-0","10.1109/IWAGPR65621.2025.11109027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11109027","GPR forward modeling;surface roughness;antenna radiation pattern;challenges in GPR interpretation","Surveys;Surface reconstruction;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Image resolution;Atmospheric modeling;Imaging;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Antenna radiation patterns","","","","16","IEEE","14 Aug 2025","2-4 July 2025","2-4 July 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we examine the amount and nature of TVWS spectrum available towards this end, considering a representative rural setting in the UK, TV transmitter locations and their configuration, terrain information and antenna type. We introduce a new notion of receiver side usable spectrum that differs from the commonly considered available spectrum at transmitter side obtained from consulting a geolocation database. We find that cumulative interference from multiple nearby TV transmitters can severely reduce the amount of usable TVWS spectrum and also heavily fragments it. However, the use of directional antennas, as would be the case for TVWS backhaul links, negates this effect and suggests the possibility of high speed TVWS backhaul links via spectrum aggregation.","2155-2509","978-1-5386-1182-1","10.1109/COMSNETS.2018.8328193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328193","","Interference;TV;Transmitters;Internet;Receivers;Signal to noise ratio;White spaces","","5","","28","IEEE","2 Apr 2018","3-7 Jan. 2018","3-7 Jan. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper an algorithm for estimating the intensity in the oval slot of a metal plate placed cross in a rectangular waveguide is proposed. It is assumed that the edges of the slot are in the form of a semicircle and the fundamental wave mode is propagated in the rectangular waveguide. The intensity in the slot is determined by an area integral. The integral area consist of a central fragment and two semicircular parts. The resolves of the area integrals are implemented. To achieve this the two-fold substitution, Newtonian binomial formula, and integral expansion are applied. The derived analytical expressions allow one to examine the influence of the description and dimensions of the slot to the intensity as well as the emitted and received powers of the slot antennas. The results can be used in the investigation of the intensity amplitude distribution in array radar antennas with oval slots.","","0-7803-6428-7","10.1109/AEM.2000.943288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=943288","","Rectangular waveguides;Slot antennas;Radar antennas;Frequency;Bandwidth;Receiving antennas;Antenna arrays","","","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","29-29 June 2000","29-29 June 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pilot observations are made for four days in August–September 2020 to record FM signals at 103.2, 104, and 107.5 MHz with a varying sample rate of 8 and 200 kHz. The in-phase and quadrature signals are processed to obtain the amplitude and phase of the received signals for identification of the meteor echoes. A new algorithm is developed to automatically detect the echoes using a normalized amplitude threshold and a minimum temporal separation between two echoes. Overdense meteor echoes with a plateau-like amplitude response are found using a ratio test and remaining echoes are rejected. Thus, the system can detect almost all types of meteor echoes reported earlier. Notably, signatures of fragmentation and background wind are also observed in the form of different phase patterns. Histogram of the meteor counts shows a peak for shorter durations indicating larger populations of the smaller size of meteoroids. The log–log plot of the meteor duration versus count is found to exhibit a characteristic transition of the slope. An empirical estimate of the height of the echoes is obtained. The echoes show micrometeoroid populations, which may depend upon the transmitting–receiving setup and the geometry. Hence, an inexpensive, low-power, portable, passive and automated meteor detection system is demonstrated, which can be highly useful for understanding the meteor phenomena and estimation of atmospheric parameters.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3187207","Department of Space, Government of India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9810301","FM radio broadcasting;forward scattering;fragmentation and ablation;meteors;micrometeoroids;software radio;upper atmosphere","Radar;Frequency modulation;Antennas;Radar antennas;Scattering;Radar scattering;Oscillators","","2","","61","IEEE","29 Jun 2022","2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The numerical simulation results show that the FHTO (e.g.,  $N\to \infty $  and  $N = 5$ ) exhibits superior focusing performance compared with the UHTO. For example, the performance of the FHTO is better than that of the UHTO by ~2.5 (5.3) times in spectral resolution (power throughput). Remarkably, even the manufacturable lenslet designed using FHTO-approach with realizable number of metal-dielectric binary layers (five pairs) demonstrates superior performance than the UHTO.

There have been increasing demands for antenna design that possess features such as size, low profile, multiband, broadband, low cost etc. Fractal antennas have entered the view of many as a very promising solution. Fractals were the term originally defined by Mandelbrot to describe the family of complex structures, which means broken or irregular fragments that possess an inherent similarity in their geometrical structure. In this paper, we have proposed a crown fractal antenna. It has been observed that simulated and experimental results of the proposed antenna have shown dual band behavior. The same geometry had proposed initially, but the substrate material used was RT-DUROID while we used FR-4 substrate here, which reduces the cost.","","978-1-5386-2393-0","10.1109/AEMC.2017.8325651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8325651","fractal;multiband;broadband;simulated","Fractals;Fractal antennas;Resonant frequency;Substrates;Broadband antennas","","","","6","IEEE","29 Mar 2018","19-22 Dec. 2017","19-22 Dec. 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the predominant methods involve handheld metal scanners that require active cooperation by the subject, generally suffering from low efficiency, limited detection range, and blind spots for nonmetallic objects. Millimeter-wave-based PSS technology, featured by its speediness, harmlessness, and capability of detecting nonmetallic materials, represents an emerging trend in security screening. However, traditional millimeter-wave system-wide dynamic scanning schemes face challenges such as bulky size, high complexity, and poor integration. To address these problems, we develop a wide-angle metalens based on a neural-network-assisted end-to-end inverse design method, aiming to replace thick and heavy dielectric lenses in traditional millimeter-wave PSS systems, thereby enhancing system integration and lightweight capabilities while improving wide-angle scanning performance. As proof of concept, we propose a system-wide static noninteractive wide-angle dual-polarized meta-detector, which consists of a dynamic beam steering transmitter, dual-polarized receivers, and a data acquisition module. This meta-detector can rapidly, precisely, and statically identify concealed objects of various materials on the human body in a noninteractive manner within a 32° horizontal and 26.8° vertical field-of-view at an operating range of 15–25 m.

More specifically, the respective center frequencies are 39GHz and 2.4GHz, whereas the bandwidth 25MHz, being the signal acquisition simultaneous for both bands. Two vehicles, each carrying a transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx), respectively, were driven in the seaside roads in Zhujiajian Island, Zhoushan, China, in four typical vehicle scenarios and in different driving modes (U-turns, etc.). Time-variant observations were segmented into multiple fragments, each with wide-sense-stationarity fulfilled, and narrowband channel characteristics, including shadowing, multipath fading, and spatial coherence behaviors were investigated. The results obtained demonstrate that most shadowing and fast-fading segments appear to be truncated Gaussian distributions for most vehicle driving modes and propagation scenarios considered. Moreover, the best-fit distribution for both shadow and multipath fadings is less changing (and hence more predictable) for the 39GHz band than for the 2.4GHz one. In most scenarios, the spatial consistency of the 2.4 GHz channel can be maintained for longer distances than at 39GHz. These results are of great value for the establishment of models aimed for channel simulations in vehicular scenarios for sub-6GHz and mmWave communications.","","978-88-31299-00-8","10.23919/EuCAP48036.2020.9135617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9135617","Vehicle to vehicle communications;channel measurement and modelling;narrow-band channel characteristics;coherence distance","Transmitters;Roads;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Stochastic processes;Spatial coherence;Rician channels;Rayleigh channels","","11","","9","","8 Jul 2020","15-20 March 2020","15-20 March 2020","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We begin by characterizing how diverse physical phenomena, ranging from human vital sign and motion to precipitation and flood dynamics, impact wireless signal propagation, producing measurable signatures in channel state information (CSI), Doppler profiles, and signal statistics. A comprehensive analysis is then presented across two domains: human sensing applications including localization, activity recognition, and vital sign monitoring; and environmental sensing for rainfall, soil moisture, and water level.

In this paper, we carefully analyze how the second D-MAC scheme proposed in [5] operates in the hidden/exposed terminal scenarios and show that it not only introduces new collisions, but also reduces spatial reuse to some extent. To remedy these problems, we propose an enhanced version of the second D-MAC scheme, called fragmentation based D-MAC (FD-MAC), to reduce collision, to achieve better spatial reuse (than the second D-MAC scheme), and to improve fairness. Through ns-2 simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FD-MAC, and in particular, we show that in complex scenarios such as multihop forwarding and mesh topologies, FD-MAC significantly outperforms DCF with RTS/CTS and the two D-MAC schemes, both in terms of throughput and fairness.","1063-6927","0-7695-1920-2","10.1109/ICDCS.2003.1203497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203497","","Wireless application protocol;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Distributed computing","","2","1","10","IEEE","11 Jun 2003","19-22 May 2003","19-22 May 2003","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the increasing presence of space debris poses a significant threat to their functionality and safety. This debris includes defunct satellites, rocket stages, and fragments from collisions with other objects, all orbiting Earth at high speeds. Such debris particles can collide with operational satellites, potentially causing damage or destruction. Such collisions could result not only in financial losses, but could even have other far-reaching ramifications. To address this challenge, this article introduces a novel thin mm-wave monopulse antenna system designed to detect space debris during satellite missions. This system compares amplitude and phase signals received through both sum and difference beams, enabling effective space debris detection. It consists of a tapered slot antenna integrated with a mm-wave rat-race design on parallel transmission lines, implemented on a PCB with a thickness of 0.17 mm.

From third generation to fourth generation, the typical data rate of cellular networks has been significantly enhanced from a megabits-per-second to almost a gigabits-per-second level [1]. According to Shannon?s communication theory, an increase of frequency bandwidth plays the key role in expanding channel capacity. However, the highly scattered allocation of long-term evolution (LTE) bands does not support contiguous expansion of bandwidth and acts as the major barrier to further channel capacity enhancement. Therefore, the LTE Advanced standard proposed the concept of carrier aggregation (CA) for the first time, as illustrated in Figure 1(a) [2]. This enables concurrent operation of multiple spectral resources such that the channel bandwidth can be effectively multiplied without increasing the signal-to-noise ratio across the entire channel [3].","1557-9581","","10.1109/MMM.2018.2875631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8575183","","Bandwidth;Long Term Evolution;Radio frequency;Filter banks;Power harmonic filters;Resonator filters;Q-factor;Channel capacity;Internet;Wireless communication","","11","","11","IEEE","13 Dec 2018","Jan. 2019","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Furthermore, detailed characterization of forest soil organic horizons is of paramount importance for ecological studies and for carbon cycle and global changerelated studies. Ultrawideband ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data acquired above beech forest litter were used to analyze the effects of litter on the backscattering and investigate the ability of GPR to quantitatively characterize the properties of the forest floor. Radar measurements were performed over different litter configurations (i.e., single layers of recently fallen litter (OL) or of fragmented litter (OF), and combined OL-OF layers) and thicknesses. Radar data were processed through full-wave inversion. Over the considered frequency range (0.8-4.0 GHz), attenuation of the radar signal increased as both frequency and litter thickness increase, due to scattering and dielectric losses. These effects were accounted for in the radar model through frequency dependence of litter apparent electrical conductivity. Good agreement (RMSE = 9.5 × 10-3 m) was observed between estimated and measured litter thicknesses. Radar data inversions provided reliable estimates of litter electromagnetic properties, with relative dielectric permittivity values around 1.2 and 3.9 for OL and OF litters, respectively, and corresponding values of 0.032 and 0.080 Sm-1 for litter apparent electrical conductivity at 4.0 GHz.

This scenario implies a reduced time for data gathering and hence a limited amount of available data.

Existing works adopt a slotted transmission strategy to reduce system complexity; they operate under the framework of coupled compressed sensing (CCS) which concatenates an outer tree code to an inner compressed sensing code for slot-wise message stitching. We suggest that by exploiting the MIMO channel information in the angular domain, redundancies required by the tree encoder/decoder in CCS can be removed to improve spectral efficiency, thereby an uncoupled transmission protocol is devised. To perform activity detection and channel estimation, we propose an expectation-maximization-aided generalized approximate message passing algorithm with a Markov random field support structure, which captures the inherent clustered sparsity structure of the angular domain channel. Then, message reconstruction in the form of a clustering decoder is performed by recognizing slot-distributed channels of each active user based on similarity. We put forward the slot-balanced  $ K $ -means algorithm as the kernel of the clustering decoder, resolving constraints and collisions specific to the application scene.

In this method, each complete Channel State Information (CSI) sample signal of each activity is sliced into piece samples, and these piece samples are trained and tested to improve the real-time performance and reduce the number of training samples. The piece sample and the sequence of piece samples are respectively regarded as the state information and environment, and the classification of each piece sample is regarded as the execution of the classification-action. A deep neural network is used to simulate the reward of classification-actions in each state, and the recognition model is established by the action-value method.

First all sensor reports are converted to likelihood's according to type. The likelihood's are based on a priori test measurements with buried objects of different materials and sizes (low metal content mine, metal shrapnel, wax, stone, sand). In the second step the joint sensor report during a given time period, e.g. one measurement with MD/GPR, is computed as a product of probabilities. Finally, nearby measurement points are updated along the scanning MD/GPR system using a Bayesian fusing method. Compared with single sensors, the two-sensor system results in enhanced probability of detecting an object with both metal content and a surrounding shell of contrasting material, e.g. a low-metal content anti-personnel mine. At the same time the false alarm rate is significantly lowered.","0537-9989","0-85296-711-X","10.1049/cp:19980715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=731296","","","","3","2","","","6 Aug 2002","12-14 Oct. 1998","12-14 Oct. 1998","IET","IET Conferences"

However, the research of polarization fingerprint (PF), which describes the physical layer features of wireless signals in the polarization domain, has just started. In this paper, PF is deeply studied, and a PF-based LoRaWAN physical layer authentication solution is designed under the actual application scenario. Firstly, the physical layer features in polarization are analyzed from the full path of polarization formation, propagation and reception, and the mathematical model of PF is constructed. There exist two main properties in PF: frequency characteristic and spatial characteristic. The spatial characteristic is the unique property of PF compared with RFF, which significantly improves the fingerprint discrimination of the same type of device. Subsequently, the solution has two authentication mechanisms according to different deployment strategies of LoRa devices: polarization fingerprint identification (PFI) based authentication and PF tracking-based authentication. PFI is implemented based on ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN), which assigns different weights to parts of PF with different discrimination to improve identification accuracy. PF tracking-based authentication solves the impact of LoRa device movement on authentication. Finally, the authentication performance and robustness of the solution are evaluated by experiments, and the ability of the solution to deal with typical attacks is analyzed. In summary, the PF-based LoRaWAN physical layer authentication solution provides considerable application potential.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2023.3295615","Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2019166); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10183875","Physical layer authentication;polarization fingerprint;radio frequency fingerprint;ensemble CNN;LoRaWAN;frequency hopping signal","Authentication;Physical layer;Security;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Wireless communication;Communication system security","","18","","44","IEEE","14 Jul 2023","2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Supervised DPCA Scheme Based on Reciprocal Filter for Clutter Cancelation From Moving OFDM Radar","A. Quirini; G. P. Blasone; F. Colone; P.

It has been shown that a range compression stage based on the reciprocal filter (RF) can be used in the signal processing scheme to mitigate the effects of the time-varying waveform on the space–time clutter cancelation. However, such an approach is effective only when the received signal is fragmented into batches consisting of individual OFDM symbols. In turn, this is a strong constraint for coherent processing technique since it affects the implementation of displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) cancelation, the equivalent pulse repetition frequency with the corresponding ambiguities and SNR losses. In order to relax this constraint, supervised thresholded reciprocal filtering strategies can be used, which enable operation over batches of any length, i.e., using a non-OFDM fragmentation, thus providing greater flexibility. However, such techniques were verified to have a nonnegligible impact on the clutter cancelation capability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a complete processing scheme that integrates the multichannel clutter suppression stage into the RF supervision strategy adopted at the range compression stage. The proposed approach is referred to as the thresholded DPCA based on RF (T-DPCA-RF) and is compared to alternatives when operating against simulated scenarios for the case of a radar equipped with two receiving channels. The performed analysis shows that the T-DPCA-RF allows a better tradeoff between clutter cancelation and target SNR while reducing the complexity of the system and enhancing its flexibility in practical cases. Preliminary tests against experimental data confirm these results.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2025.3527953","European Union under the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan(grant numbers:PE00000001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10841903","Clutter cancelation;displaced phase center antenna (DPCA);integrated sensing and communication (ISAC);joint radar and communication (JRC);moving platforms;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radar;reciprocal filter (RF);supervised reciprocal filter","Radar;OFDM;Clutter;Radar antennas;Radio frequency;Radar clutter;Signal to noise ratio;Symbols;Radar signal processing;Aerospace and electronic systems","","2","","29","CCBY","14 Jan 2025","June 2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In response to the demands of modern multi-system communication and indoor environments, omnidirectional antennas with broad bandwidth, miniaturization, and low profile have become a research hotspot in recent years. This report mainly introduces three types of omnidirectional antennas for indoor mobile base station. Firstly, an ultrawideband omnidirectional patch antenna with vertical polarization and low profile is introduced. It composes of a circular patch, eight short pins and a circular ground plane. Two propagation modes of TM01 and TM02 are produced when the circular patch is excited by a 1-to-8 power divider, while other two propagation modes of TM01 and TM02 are additionally excited by embedding two ring slots in the ground plane. A circular slot is then loaded in the circular patch to enhance the impedance matching at the higher frequency band, thus widening the operating bandwidth. By using such a new mechanism, the multiple modes are combined to realize good impedance matching and omnidirectional radiation with vertical polarization during an ultrawide bandwidth of 110% (1.57-5.39 GHz). Secondly, a horizontal-polarized omnidirectional antenna with an extremely wide bandwidth and small gain variation is proposed. To attain horizontal-polarized omnidirectional performance and small size, eight shared dipoles, which are round-connected into an octagon-shaped array, are excited by a 1-to-8 power divider. To significantly improve the impedance matching and omnidirectional performance over a very broad operating frequency band, fragmented metal strips are introduced around the shared dipoles. In the proposed design, a desirable bandwidth of 92.3% (1.4−3.8 GHz) is obtained under a compact size of π × (0.32 λL)2 × 0.01 λL. Apart from that, the wideband antenna also attains excellent gain variation of smaller than 1.5 dB at the operating band. Finally, an effective design method for an aperture-shared broadband dual-polarized omnidirectional antenna with a very low profile is introduced. An ultra-low-profile verticalpolarized omnidirectional antenna is realized by utilizing a 1- to-4 power divider to excite a metal disk with four fan-shaped slots, which is located upon a circular reflector and connected to the reflector by twelve identical metal pillars. Then a horizontal-polarized omnidirectional element, which is designed based on an 8-unit dipole array, is fed by a broadband 1-to-8 power divider. To attain an aperture-shared dual-polarized antenna, the reflector of the vertical-polarized antenna is replaced by the horizontal-polarized element. In this innovative scheme, the dual-polarized omnidirectional antenna achieves a wide co-frequency bandwidth of 95% (1.6−4.5 GHz) and an ultra-low profile of about 0.05λL.","2994-3124","979-8-3503-8996-8","10.1109/ICMMT61774.2024.10671989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10671989","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jan 2026","16-19 May 2024","16-19 May 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We design a novel system architecture that enables high-speed Internet access in railway systems. The proposed design uses a number of repeaters placed along the track and multiple antennas installed on the roof of a vehicle. Each packet is decomposed into smaller fragments and relayed to the vehicle via adjacent repeaters. We also use erasure coding to add parity fragments to original data. This approach is called information raining since fragments are rained upon the vehicle from adjacent repeaters. We investigate two instances of information raining. In blind information raining, all repeaters awaken when they sense the presence of the vehicle. The fragments are then blindly transmitted via awakened repeaters. A vehicle station installed inside the train is responsible for aggregating a large enough number of fragments. In the throughput-optimized information raining, the vehicle station selects a bipartite matching between repeaters and roof-top antennas and activates only a subset of the repeaters. It also dictates the amount of transmission power of each activated repeater. Both the bipartite matching and power allocations are individually shown to be NP-complete. Matching heuristics based on the Hungarian algorithm and Gale-Shapley algorithm are proposed. A simplex-type algorithm is proposed as the power allocation heuristics.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2005.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413185","Index Terms- Emerging technologies;network architecture and design;wireless communication;network protocols;mobile communication systems;mobile environments;medium access control;mobile hotspots;graphs and networks;linear programming;constrained optimization;graph theory;combinatorial algorithms.","Vehicles;Repeaters;Low earth orbit satellites;Internet;Rail transportation;Virtual private networks;Wireless LAN;Bit error rate;Microcell networks;Telecommunication traffic","","35","3","43","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","May-June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to analyze and evaluate the global characteristic and overall situation of interference, the temporal and spatial cut set of interference is established by fragmenting time and gridding space. The correctness of the proposed NGSO constellation satellite distribution state period is verified by taking the OneWeb constellation’s interference to the SINOSAT-5 satellite communication system as the simulation scenario. Furthermore, the global interference characteristic of the OneWeb constellation to the SINOSAT-5 satellite communication system is analyzed with the method mentioned above in the range of 80 °E–140 °E and 0 °N–50 °N.

The identification of fragmentation has been based on a detailed interpretation, based on radio science, of head- and trail-echo properties. We now extend the discussion of fragmenting meteoroids to include apparent high-altitude (130–180 km) meteors observed at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO). While there have been a few reports of high-altitude meteors observed both optically and with radar, the meteor radar community has remained sceptical, with suspicions of antenna side-lobe contamination being the most commonly raised objection. We report results from two sets of meteor observations carried out at JRO in 2010 April. Our findings include meteoroid fragmentation results that are similar to those from the Arecibo VHF radar. These findings lead to the conclusions that fragmentation is not only observed at the JRO but that k⊥B scattering adds an interesting additional radio science dimension to the issue. We also report on apparent high-altitude meteor events that, if ultimately confirmed, offer insight into sputtering as a source of the meteor ionization, and perhaps indicate the unique importance of magnetic field geometry in these head-echo observations. Also, new, apparently high-altitude transient events, likely related to the meteoroid flux, have been identified. In presenting these results, we note our careful calibration of the JRO radar, utilizing satellite returns in order to largely, if not totally, exclude side-lobe contamination and other possible error sources, as reported in our companion paper.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196182","techniques: radar astronomy;meteorites;meteors;meteoroids","","","2","","","","19 Jan 2018","Feb. 2015","","OUP","OUP Journals"

A simple efficiency index is also proposed as a performance indicator at various subpacketization levels.

Apart from theoretical considerations, the results of real-life experiments are discussed.

In this paper both the matched subspace detector (MSD) and the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) MSD are adopted to multiple antennas and extended to the detection of fragmented telegrams.

Three bands where investigated UHF, L and X band expecting a tradeoff between cover penetration and target radar cross-section, the latter being critical due to the expected high clutter radar cross-section. Four sites were imaged, a calibration zone and a front glacier close to Kangerlussuaq, a dry accumulation zone North of the polar circle, a percolated accumulation zone East of Narsassuaq, and an intermediate zone between accumulation and ablation zone. The engine fragment plume of an uncontained engine failure on a commercial jet-liner (about 190 days earlier) was in the middle of the percolated accumulation zone, providing several known buried fragments, as well as opportunities to unravel unknown buried fragments that may have an interest for the engine failure investigation. Test objects (corner reflectors, Luneburg lens, ice filed plastic sled, snow refilled hole) have been setup at known positions and depths to assess detection through cover and ice drift rates. Processing of the data confirmed the high clutter return, the better penetration at low (UHF) band and the higher radar cross-section at high (X) band.

Unlike conventional fragmented designs, the lossless reflective layer is produced by eliminating loss from the lossy layer, leading to the additional benefit of a more adaptable multiband match. The series-embedded resonator integrated with p-i-n diodes is presented to switch the open-circuit frequencies, allowing multiple windows to switch between transmission and absorption modes over a flexible frequency range. Consistent metallic-strip-based configuration ensures consistent transmission characteristics for both layers under the same control scheme, facilitating coordinated design for transmission/absorption in multiple bands. A prototype of the active rasorber is fabricated for demonstration. The single-polarized response of the structure has been validated in the polarization direction parallel to the metallic strips. The transparent windows can be toggled between dual-pass-band mode (A-T-A-T-A) at 3.5 and 8 GHz, and single-pass-band (A-T-A) mode at 6 GHz. Flexible frequency ratios of 2.3:1 and 1.33:1 are achieved. The reflection is effectively suppressed when the window is closed, and it consistently exhibits such behavior outside the window.

Three algorithms for constructing the UAV trajectory are proposed: an algorithm for pairing courses, an algorithm based on continuous piecewise linear functions (CPLF) with a fixed step, and an algorithm based on an adaptive CPLF with a non-fixed step. The analysis of disadvantages of each algorithm is performed. The aircraft trajectory fragment was approximated using the CPLF.

We compare the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and PCID detection probabilities of three PSS detection methods: cross-correlation based detection before frequency offset (FO) estimation and compensation, that after FO estimation and compensation, and autocorrelation based detection at a set of user equipment. Link- level simulation results show that the cross- correlation based PSS detection before the FO estimation and compensation achieves the highest PSS and PCID detection probabilities in the carrier frequency fc region lower than approximately 14 GHz at the average received signal-to-noise power ratio of 0 dB for the standard oscillator frequency error of 1 ppm. The cross-correlation based PSS detection after the FO estimation and compensation achieves much higher PSS and PCID detection probabilities than that before the FO estimation and compensation for the fc region higher than approximately 14 GHz. The PCID detection probability of the cross-correlation based PSS detection after the FO estimation and compensation is close to that of the autocorrelation based PSS detection according to the increase in the fc value. Therefore, we conclude that by switching the cross- correlation based PSS detection methods before and after the FO estimation and compensation, the PSS and secondary synchronization signal structures based on the NR radio interface achieve a high PCID detection probability for the fc value up to 60 GHz.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-1220-6","10.1109/VTCFall.2019.8891182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891182","","OFDM;Indexes;Correlation;Estimation;5G mobile communication;Synchronization","","12","","8","IEEE","7 Nov 2019","22-25 Sept. 2019","22-25 Sept. 2019","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This applies even to discrimination of shallow sizable metallic objects, such as unexploded ordnance (UXO), which are to be found predominantly in the top meter of soil. The environment typically features widespread metallic clutter from detonated ordnance or other sources. Such fragments can be numerous and are often shallower than the objects of interest. Currently, the preeminent remote sensing mode for buried UXO is ultrawideband electromagnetic induction (EMI), operating over part or all of the band from some tens of hertz up to perhaps hundreds of kilohertz. Particularly because EMI fields fall off sharply with range, signals from shallow clutter may be relatively strong and can easily obscure essential scatterer signatures. To treat this, a rational theory of EMI scattering from widespread metallic clutter is formulated and tested. For dense, well-distributed clutter, analytical rules are derived for dependence of signal strength on sensor elevation, under various fundamental excitation types. For more erratic, sparse clutter distributions, signal statistics from Monte Carlo simulations show patterns like those from the analytical rules. The dependence of clutter signal magnitude on antenna elevation is determined for both thin surface layers and for volume layers of widespread small items, and for both dense and sparse clutter distributions. These are contrasted with the patterns expected from single, larger, discrete objects of interest, and the contrast is exploited in discrimination exercises for the screening problem. For sparse clutter distributions, results from inversion processing formulations that account for the patterns of clutter statistics are compared to simple least squares treatments.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.858437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564393","Clutter;electromagnetic induction (EMI);subsurface;unexploded ordnance (UXO)","Electromagnetic interference;Remote sensing;Electromagnetic scattering;Signal analysis;Statistical distributions;Signal processing;Buried object detection;Soil;Ultra wideband technology;Electromagnetic induction","","4","","30","IEEE","27 Dec 2005","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inspired by cross-layer design, receiver-initiated MAC and fragment burst of IEEE 802.11, a new MAC protocol supporting priority differentiation for IVC based on IEEE 802.11 is proposed in this paper. With this approach, top priority applications can be relayed from source car to destination with minimum contentions, redundant overhead such as require-to-send (RTS) and distributed inter-fame space (DIES) is also retrenched. Another new term named relay-interruption can introduce more contention for lower priority applications and traditional IEEE 802.11 four-way frame exchange is applied for lowest priority traffic.

However, utilizing the mmWave technology on HSRs will result in large Doppler shifts, which should be estimated and compensated. Traditional Doppler shift estimators, such as the cyclic prefix (CP)-based estimator (CPBE), the two-training-symbol-based estimator (TBE), and the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), have inferior estimation accuracy especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we, therefore, propose three new Doppler shift estimators for mmWave communication systems on HSRs: a radio environment map (REM)-based estimator (RBE) derived from the maximum a posteriori algorithm; an equally-divided structure-based estimator (ESBE) that divides the effective orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing symbol (OFDM) into multiple equal fragments; and an enhanced ESBE (EESBE) that takes the results of RBE as a priori knowledge.

Nami is in a system that combines wetlands and coastal depositional packages of marine and aeolian sediments in addition to archaeological features. These environments are very complex in terms of their geophysical (dielectric) properties. In addition, the proximity to the sea and the intrusion of seawater to the subterranean medium creates areas with high high salinity (conductive) and high water content values. Four areas were selected for GPR data collection to create amplitude maps and collected with 400MHz and 270MHz antennas. A total of 7,450 sq meters of data was collected. Each of the grids shows a complex series of depositional units from different environments that provide a framework of ancient habitations. In two 3D surveys, archaeological features were detected, indicating fragments of walls and floors. Under them, in one instance high reflective features were detected. These are likely aeolianite sandstone, in contrast to low reflective limestone, the usual building material of the site of the period.

At the final step of timing closure, free metal segments and hold violating nets are both fragmented and scattered over the design. We thus partition a design and perform minimum cost network flow to assign proper free metal segments to hold violating nets. Our experiments are conducted on six industrial smartphone designs with TSMC 16nm process, and our results show that compared with the conventional buffer insertion method, our approach can reduce 37% hold time buffer area, promising for saving leakage power and maintaining area utilization-suited to the final step of timing closure.","","978-1-4503-4927-7","10.1145/3061639.3062303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8060436","Timing closure;hold time fixing;free metal segments","Metals;Delays;Resource management;Routing;Merging;Antennas","","","","22","","9 Oct 2017","18-22 June 2017","18-22 June 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, no standard data communication mechanism has been defined for the communication between these elements. Therefore, O-DUs may not work efficiently in O-DU pool, limiting the RAN performance. This paper investigates an optimized solution for routing and packet scheduling, allowing multiple O-DU pools to communicate with their O-RUs meeting the requirements of different 5G classes of service. We propose an O-DU pool architecture and formulate the problem of optimal routing and packet scheduling to forward Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols over the optimal routes and map UDP packet sizes to fragment OFDM symbols. Numerical results show our solution can select the optimal routes and packet sizes to carry requested traffic.

This task becomes particularly challenging in complex urban environments, especially when communication occurs over millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands, due to the fragmented coverage of cells in such situations. This paper studies the performance gains that is feasible when the trajectory of the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is selected according to the QoS that the 6G network can provide in different parts of a Manhattan grid layout. More precisely, a graph is constructed in which the nodes are the crossroads and the weight of the edges connecting nodes is proportional to the minimum Spectral Efficiency (SE) across the streets that connect the given intersections. Then, the end-to-end trajectory of the vehicle can be selected based on the Maximizing the Minimum (Max-Min) scheme, which maximizes the minimum SE, encountered by the AV. The simulation results show that the proposed Max-Min scheme achieves significant performance improvements, delivering notable gains in the order of 40%-60% (20%-30%) are observed for 10th (50th) percentile SE, when the trajectory from the starting point to the destination is optimized based on the coverage of the mobile network.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3543204","ASPIRE Award for Research Excellence under Grant Abu Dhabi Award for Research Excellence (AARE-2020)-368; United Arab Emirates University (UAEU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10891763","6G;autonomous driving;vehicle-to-network communication;QoS;trajectory planning;urban area;mmWave","Base stations;Quality of service;Millimeter wave communication;Trajectory;Signal to noise ratio;Reflection;Interference;6G mobile communication;Urban areas;Roads","","","","28","CCBY","18 Feb 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing methods often face limitations in feature representation efficiency and generalization under constrained hardware setups. In this work, we propose continuous angle-of-arrival and time-of-flight maps (CATM), a novel and easily learnable feature extraction framework that jointly encodes spatial and temporal dynamics of human activities using commercial Wi-Fi devices. By integrating smoothed channel state information (CSI) with MUSIC-based signal processing, CATM constructs 2-D heatmaps that unify angle-of-arrival (AoA) and time-of-flight (ToF) features, enabling robust representation of both coarse and fine-grained movements. Unlike conventional approaches relying on fragmented temporal or spectral features, CATM inherently embeds continuous spatiotemporal patterns that simplify downstream model learning. Our lightweight Res-BiLSTM network, trained on CATM features, achieves 93.2% accuracy across eight activities and five users, under three displacement ways, and outperforms other single-domain methods. Crucially, CATM demonstrates exceptional transferability: when adapted to unseen device placements, the framework retains 80% accuracy with only 20% retraining data, significantly reducing dependence on extensive labeled datasets. These results demonstrate that CATM provides a more informative feature extraction method compared to traditional approaches relying on CSI amplitude and Doppler information for HAR.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2025.3616769","U.K. EPSRC CHEDDAR Communications Hub(grant numbers:EP/X040518/1,EP/Y037421/1,ARCOM EP/Z533609/1,EP/T021020/1,EP/T021063/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11195979","Angle of arrival;human activity recognition;transfer learning;Wi-Fi sensing","Wireless fidelity;Human activity recognition;Sensors;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Accuracy;Radar tracking;Data mining;Internet of Things;Hardware","","","","35","IEEE","7 Oct 2025","15 Nov.15, 2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The conventional approaches of resolving EMIS problems encounter assorted difficulties, such as high contrast, high computational cost, inevitable intrinsic nonlinearity, and strong ill-posedness. To surmount these difficulties, a novel DL approach is proposed based on a novel complex-valued deep fully convolutional neural network structure. The proposed complex-valued deep learning model for solving EMIS problems composes of an encoder network and its corresponding decoder network, followed by a final pixel-wise regression layer. The complex-valued encoder network extracts feature fragments from received scattered field data, while the role of the complex-valued decoder network is mapping the feature fragments to retrieve the final contrasts (permittivities) of dielectric scatterers. Hence, the proposed deep learning model functions as an “heterogeneous” transformation process, where measured scattering field data is converted into the corresponding contrasts of scatterers. As a consequence, the EMIS problem could be resolved accurately even for extremely high-contrast targets. Numerical benchmarks have illustrated the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed approach.

Two image processing algorithms based on either maximum or minimum entropy, namely, the Burg algorithm and the alternative iteration deconvolution based on minimum entropy (AIDME) are compared.

Extensive RCS measurements performed by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and corresponding ballistic analysis by the USAF Space Command narrowed the potential candidates down to just two possible classes of objects: (1) a section of reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) leading edge panel acreage; (2) a section of RCC ""tee-seals"". During the investigation, AFRL was asked to estimate the UHF RCS of various whole and fragmentary tee-seals to compare with the on-orbit UHF RCS observations. Since actual Orbiter tee-seal hardware, either whole or fractured, were not available, we predicted UHF RCS on various virtual tee-seal fragment geometries to confirm or eliminate the tee-seal as a candidate for the FD2 object. The paper summarizes our UHF RCS predictions, which definitively show that a whole or partial RCC tee-seal could not be the FD2 object.

Existing sea ice boundary detection efforts are primarily based on satellite observations, which are limited in spatial and temporal resolution. This study addresses this limitation by presenting the first Arctic application of shipborne global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) for real-time detection of sea ice transition zones. The method passively receives L1-band GNSS signals reflected from the sea surface, using power fluctuations—linked to changes in surface dielectric properties—as indicators of ice–water transitions. Two field experiments aboard the Chinese icebreaker Xuelong 2 demonstrate that GNSS-R can stably and repeatedly capture transition zone signatures with minute-level temporal resolution. Within each ~1 km experimental track, the retrieved sea ice concentration time series quantitatively reflects fluctuations corresponding to an effective spatial resolution of approximately 31 m, thereby enabling the detection of distinct signal characteristics between continuous ice edges and fragmented ice. Synchronized onboard video provides independent validation, showing overall detection accuracies exceeding 80%. This work establishes GNSS-R as a low-cost, passive, and high-resolution technique for operational monitoring of sea ice transition zones, supporting safer navigation and improved understanding of polar processes.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2025.3645706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11303216","Arctic;GNSS reflectometry;polar regions;sea ice transition zones","Sea ice;Ice;Global navigation satellite system;Sea surface;Videos;Arctic;Reflector antennas;Monitoring;Spatial resolution;Permittivity","","","","15","IEEE","17 Dec 2025","2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deterministic modeling is difficult and some stochastic arguments should be introduced instead. In this paper, we introduce the concept of random networks. One remarkable feature of random graphs is that a phase transition occurs as the probability of edge connection increases. At the critical probability, fragmented pieces of edges suddenly start to be mutually connected, forming one large component. This graph-theoretical change parallels phase transitions in states of mutter, e.g. the jump from water to ice. In ad hoc sensor networks, the nodes are connected by wireless links. In order to meet this requirement, we propose a model using percolation, a kind of random graph where the edges are formed only between the nearby nodes. We also present some numerical examples to simulate the jump effects of the phase transition.","2331-9860","0-7803-8784-8","10.1109/CCNC.2005.1405152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405152","","Graph theory;Wireless sensor networks;Tree graphs;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Stochastic processes;Ice;Information technology;Laboratories;Numerical simulation;Ad hoc networks","","17","","19","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","6-6 Jan. 2005","6-6 Jan. 2005","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional approaches for solving inhomogeneous EMIS problems generally have to consider inhomogeneous Green’s functions or conduct approximation operations to media, which inevitably introduces various challenges, including complex mathematical derivation, high computation cost, unavoidable nonlinearity, and even strong ill-posedness. To avoid these challenges, we propose a DL approach based on the complex-valued deep convolutional neural networks (DConvNets), which comprise the deep convolutional encoder–decoder (DCED) structure. Its training data are collected based on the simple synthetic dataset. While the scattered fields received in the measurement domain are utilized as the input for the encoder to extract feature fragments, the final output for the counterpart decoder is the contrasts (permittivities) of dielectric scatterers in the target domain. In this way, unlike the conventional methods, the unknown domain between the target domain and measurement domain never has to be considered to compute inhomogeneous Green’s functions. Consequently, the inhomogeneous EMIS problems could be solved with higher accuracy even for extremely high-contrast targets. Numerical examples illustrate the feasibility of the proposed DL approach.

In this paper, we propose a novel 2D autofocus algorithm, thoroughly utilizing all the available data and therefore achieving superior estimation performance. Via analytical study, we show that the partial derivative of the 2D error with respect to the azimuth frequency is approximable as a function of single argument, after appropriate change of variable. The established property enables a scheme for the azimuth phase error (APE) measurement, where the polar formatted data are fragmented along the range frequency and then aligned along the azimuth frequency, in order to equalize phase gradients in different fragments. On the one hand, such a scheme avoids the necessity to divide the full-aperture signal into subapertures, while on the other hand, it involves the whole signal support. Improved accuracy of the resulting estimate is achieved through the joint inter-fragment estimation of the APE gradient. The proposed algorithm, based on the mentioned scheme, was validated via computer simulations. The conducted experiments confirmed its preference against the existing techniques.

A spherically symmetric source model is convolved with realistic uv-plane distributions, together with standard imaging procedures, to assess the extent of instrumental effects on the recovered brightness distribution. In order to facilitate direct comparisons between the simulations and published VLBI images of SN 1993J, the observed uv-coverage is determined from actual VLBI observations made in the years following its discovery. The underlying source model only exhibits radial variation in its density profile, with no azimuthal dependence and, even though this model is morphologically simple, the simulated VLBI observations qualitatively reproduce many of the azimuthal features of the reported VLBI observations, such as appearance and evolution of complex azimuthal structure and apparent rotation of the shell. We demonstrate that such features are inexorably coupled to the uv-plane sampling. The brightness contrast between the peaks and the surrounding shell material are not as prominent in the simulations (which of course assume no antenna- or baseline-based amplitude or phase errors, meaning no self-calibration procedures will have incorporated any such features in models). It is conclusive that incomplete uv-plane sampling has a drastic effect on the final images for observations of this nature. Difference imaging reveals residual emission up to the 8σ level.

As far as we are concerned, no mandatory regulations were established so far for interference control in the cases where multiple vehicles equipped with automotive radars exist in close proximity. Consequently, those inter-vehicle cross-interference easily result in the radar performance degradation, e.g. incapability of target detection and identification. In this paper, an interference suppression algorithm is proposed which utilizes two Recursive-Least-Square (RLS) adaptive filters to estimate, the interference signals caused by the “aggressor” radar and the echo signals from the “ego” radar. The algorithm operates in the iterative mode with its initial input being the originally received beat signals involving interference. In each iteration, the estimates of the interference signals and of the clean signals are calculated sequentially by the two RLS filters, and the beat signal is updated with parts of the fragments substituted with their interference-mitigated counterparts. Such iterative operations stop when the convergence criterion, e.g. none of the fragments in the beat signals are considered being interfered, is achieved or the iteration number reaches the limit predefined due to the practical constraints. Simulation and measurement results demonstrate that the proposed dual-RLS-based algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of lower interference-to-signal ratio resultant and superior capability of retrieving the original range-Doppler profile.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3274820","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61971313); Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of China(grant numbers:QN2022133003L,as well as by Zongmu Technology,the Sino-German Center of Intelligent Systems,Tongji University); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10133873","Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar;interference suppression;adaptive noise canceller;RLS adaptive algorithm","Radar;Interference;Chirp;Radar antennas;Automotive engineering;Signal processing algorithms;Frequency-domain analysis","","6","","46","IEEE","24 May 2023","Oct. 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike terrestrial users, UAVs face frequent handovers due to antenna side-lobe coverage and fragmented aerial cell overlaps. Existing optimization strategies, however, are often limited to coarse-grained “whether-to-handover” decisions or unidirectional cell individual offset (CIO) tuning, resulting in degraded handover performance. To address these problems, this paper proposes an Event-triggered Bidirectional CIO Optimization with Hybrid prioritized experience replay based Deep Reinforcement Learning (EBCO-HDRL) algorithm. Under the A3 event-triggered mechanism, EBCO-HDRL jointly configures serving-to-neighbor and neighbor-to-serving CIOs, improving handover accuracy and reducing ping-pong events. An event-triggered optimization strategy adaptively reconfigures CIOs only when needed, mitigating computational overhead and enhancing training stability. To further improve sample efficiency, a Hybrid Prioritized Experience Replay (HPER) scheme is introduced, combining temporal-difference error and high-reward sampling, supported by a heterogeneous neural network design. Simulation results show that EBCO-HDRL significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of precision, stability, and robustness, offering an effective solution for UAV handover management in cellular IoT networks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2025.3645389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11303183","Cell Individual Offset;Cellular-Connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;Deep Reinforcement Learning","Handover;Optimization;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Event detection;Internet of Things;Antennas;Decision making;Hysteresis;Trajectory;Stability criteria","","","","","IEEE","18 Dec 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Different from the detection of ordinary objects with pre-definable classes, detecting unexpected obstacles on the road cannot be resolved by upscaling the sensor technology alone (e.g., high resolution video imagers / radar antennas, denser LiDAR scan lines). This is due to the fact, that there is a wide variety in the types of unexpected obstacles that also do not share a common appearance (e.g., lost cargo as a suitcase or bicycle, tire fragments, a tree stem). Also adding object classes or adding ""all"" of these objects to a common ""unexpected obstacle"" class does not scale. In this contribution, we study the feasibility of using a deep learning video-based lane corridor (called ""AI ego-corridor"") to ease the challenge by inverting the problem: Instead of detecting a previously unseen object, the AI ego-corridor detects that the ego-lane ahead ends. A smart ground-truth definition enables an easy feature-based classification of an abrupt end of the ego-lane. We propose two neural network designs and research among other things the potential of training with synthetic data. We evaluate our approach on a test vehicle platform. It is shown that the approach is able to detect numerous previously unseen obstacles at a distance of up to 300 m with a detection rate of 95 %.","2642-7214","979-8-3503-4691-6","10.1109/IV55152.2023.10186607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10186607","Model-free object detection;PEBAL;out-of-distribution;mono video","Training;Image resolution;Roads;Neural networks;Radar detection;Radar imaging;Radar antennas","","","","18","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","4-7 June 2023","4-7 June 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We analyse the dynamics of a disc forming around an SMBH, in which the angular momentum is transported by turbulence induced by the disc's self-gravity. We find that once the surface density of the disc exceeds a critical value, the disc fragments into dense clumps. We argue that the clumps accrete material from the remaining disc and merge into larger clumps; the upper mass of a merged clump is a few tens to a few hundreds of solar mass. This picture fits well with the observed young stellar discs near the SgrA* black hole in the Galactic Centre. In particular, we show how the masses and spatial distribution of the young stars, and the total mass in the Galactic Centre discs can be explained. However, explaining the origin of the several young stars closest to the black hole (the S-stars) is more problematic: their orbits are compact, eccentric, and have random orientation. We propose that the S-stars were born in a previous starburst(s), and then migrated through their parent disc via type-I or runaway migration. Their orbits were then randomized by the Rauch–Tremaine resonant relaxation. We then explore the consequences of the star formation scenario for AGN discs, which are continuously resupplied with gas. We argue that some compact remnants generated by the starburst will get embedded in the disc. The disc-born stellar mass black holes will interact gravitationally with the massive accretion disc and be dragged towards the central black hole. Merger of a disc-born black hole with the central black hole will produce a burst of gravitational waves. If the central black hole is accreting at a rate comparable to the Eddington limit, the gas drag from the accretion disc will not alter significantly the dynamics of the final year of merger, and the gravitational waves should be observable by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For a reasonable range of parameters such mergers will be detected monthly, and that the gravitational-wave signal from these mergers is distinct from that of other merger scenarios. Also, for some plausible black hole masses and accretion rates, the burst of gravitational waves should be accompanied by a detectable change in the optical luminosity of the central engine.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.11155.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8343896","accretion, accretion discs;stars: formation","","","","","","","23 Apr 2018","Jan. 2007","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Using a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receiver installed on a surface vehicle to capture the GPS messages is a significant step towards the automatization of geolocating the pop-up buoys and tracking their trajectory as they drift.

Our system learns baseline behaviours and provides insights to the operators alerting them about deviations from this learnt behaviour.

To be able to provide these features, more spectrum is required according to the Shannon-Hartley theorem. Spectrum is, however, a finite and scarce resource, and it can be allocated to a new service only when the spectral coexistence with other incumbents is ensured. New waveforms for 5G that differ from the conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) are required in order to have a superior performance in terms of out-of-band emissions and to be able to utilize the fragmented spectrum in different bands. We developed the analytical models for evaluating the out-of-band emissions of the conventional cyclic prefix (CP)-OFDM as well as its alternatives: windowed OFDM and filtered OFDM, using their signal spectral modeling. The resulting expressions for the power spectral density (PSD) and the frequency-dependent rejection (FDR) involve simple closed-form expressions or easily computable integrals. We applied the expressions to the advanced minimum coupling loss model for assessing the feasibility of the spectral coexistence between the potential 5G systems (with linearized or nonlinear power amplifier) and the incumbent radar systems. The numerical simulation results indicate that both the windowed OFDM and filtered OFDM guarantee the coexistence at the low expense of the spectrum utilization and their coexistence performance can be reduced and reversed with nonlinearity distortion of the power amplifier.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896280","Agency for Defense Development; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:NRF-2016R1C1B2011921); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629906","Coexistence study;CP-OFDM;fifth-generation (5G) cellular mobile communications;filtered OFDM;frequency dependent rejection;frequency sharing study;out-of-band emission;power amplifier nonlinearity;power spectral density","OFDM;5G mobile communication;Interference;Radar;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Numerical models","","18","","57","OAPA","30 Jan 2019","2019","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, this paper proposes a low-altitude digital-intelligent network (LADIN) as an overarching architecture, with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) serving as the core enabling technology that pervasively unifies its three layers. At the heterogeneous infrastructure layer, we detail an ISAC waveform design based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, enabling dual-purpose hardware to simultaneously achieve high-speed data transmission and high-precision environmental sensing. Within the intelligent data fusion layer, ISAC's role expands into a multimodal fusion paradigm, providing the crucial electromagnetic sensing modality. This layer constructs a unified spatiotemporal feature space by introducing pluggable back-projection adapters and spatiotemporal modeling. These adapters systematically integrate heterogeneous data from ISAC, optical cameras, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) by inverting their respective observation models, thereby overcoming representational disparities and association ambiguities. At the service and management layer, this coherent representation directly drives algorithmic processes and control policies. ISAC resources are virtualized into dynamically allocable assets, enabling closed-loop control that responds to the real-time state of the feature space, such as reconfiguring base station operational modes based on live situational awareness. Validation through multi-frequency collaborative sensing and multimodal fusion use cases demonstrates significant performance gains in tracking robustness, detection of near-zero radar cross-section targets such as balloons, and seamless urban airspace governance, conclusively establishing the transformative potential of a deeply integrated, ISAC-centric approach for future LAE systems.","2095-9230","","10.1631/FITEE.2500547","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L232003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62341101,62321001,62401077,62472048); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB4300403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11345611","Low-altitude economy;Integrated sensing and communication;Airspace management;Uncrewed aerial vehicles;Cyber-physical system","Adaptation models;Target tracking;Data integration;Collaboration;Integrated sensing and communication;Radar tracking;Hardware;Robustness;Data models;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","","","26","","12 Jan 2026","December 2025","","ZUP","ZUP Journals"

However, as an effort to overcome the insufficient frequency-band resource in FR1, telecommunication companies are continuously securing additional re-farming bands in FR1, and they are extending maximum throughput by applying Carrier Aggregation/E-UTRA NR Dual connectivity (CA/EN-DC) based on many fragment bands as shown in Fig. 27.5.1. For example, a major telecommunication company supports CA/EN-DC of the B1, B3, B5, B7 (1), B7 (2), and n78 bands, which require more than 20 RX paths considering the antenna diversity and 4x4 MIMO needed for maximum throughput. As the demands for spectrum re-farming increase, more fragment bands are used, and the required numbers of RX paths also increase accordingly in a conventional direct-conversion-receiver (DCR) architecture. In addition, to support the various fragment bands, multiple front-end modules (FEMs) are required and each FEM needs to be highly complexed with higher-performance multiplexers such as octaplexers or hexaplexers to maintain TX-RX isolation for TX desensitization from IIP2 as shown in Fig. 27.5.1. When B1 TX and RX are activated with B3 RX simultaneously, the isolation between the B1 TX and B3 RX path is more difficult to achieve than that between the B1 TX and RX path due to the reduced duplex spacing (i.e., 40MHz from 130MHz). Also, a local-oscillator (LO) leakage power from in-band LO frequency as well as leakage powers from the adjacent LO harmonics are added to the DC offset of receiver chains. These issues can be relaxed by a multiple-channel-processing receiver with IF conversion such as a software-defined-radio (SDR) receiver or by cognitive radio (CR) receivers that can break through the shortage of FR1 band by searching and adapting unoccupied bands in real time.","2376-8606","978-1-6654-2800-2","10.1109/ISSCC42614.2022.9731796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9731796","","Multiplexing;Technological innovation;Spatial diversity;Receivers;Companies;Power system harmonics;Throughput","","3","","4","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","20-26 Feb. 2022","20-26 Feb. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, by detecting the fragmental variation trend, it is possible to maintain and control industrial systems.

Therefore, this paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on a temporal sequential predicting approach. In this paper, a statistical-based threshold generation approach is researched to improve the accuracy of the threshold. At the same time, a gated recurrent unit sequence-to-sequence (GRU-Seq2Seq) model is established to predict the trend of abnormal fragments, and the residual between the predicted fragments and the real fragments is used for anomaly detection to enhance the slowly changing fault characteristics and improve the detection rate.

"GPS and AUVs: a solution to the problem of signal interruption","D. T. Meldrum","Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratory, Oban, UK",IEE Colloquium on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and their Systems - Recent Developments and Future Prospects,"6 Aug 2002","1996","","","7/1","7/7","Autosub, an AUV, called surfaces periodically to communicate with its base and to determine its position. The satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) has been chosen as the prime candidate for this latter requirement because of its near-instantaneous global coverage, and because of the challenges inherent in adopting a leading-edge technology as a principal component in the overall design. However, GPS suffers from a major disadvantage, namely the difficulty of acquiring fresh satellite orbital parameters (the ephemeris) in the presence of periodic wave washover of the GPS antenna. This problem was tackled in two stages. Firstly, the dynamics of the AUV and the consequent antenna masking and interaction with the GPS carrier and code tracking loops were simulated, leading to the development and validation of a novel algorithm for reconstruction of the GPS satellite message from fragments. The algorithm was then embedded in the firmware of a production GPS receiver and tested under practical conditions of signal disruption, including sea trials in a full-size model AUV hull.","","","10.1049/ic:19960661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=543752","","Global Positioning System;Mobile robots;Interference;Signal reconstruction","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","1-1 May 1996","1-1 May 1996","IET","IET Conferences"

A slot plane antenna plasma oxidation (SPAO) process was implemented during dielectric deposition steps to fabricate TiN/ZrO2/Al2O3/p-Ge MOS gate stacks. A poor interface was observed with SPAO being performed before Al2O3/ZrO2 gate stack deposition because of fragmented GeOX interfacial layer formation. Significant decrease in interface state density was observed because of the formation of a stable and moderately thick GeOX interfacial layer when SPAO was performed in between Al2O3/ZrO2 deposition. When SPAO was performed after the deposition of both the high-k layers, higher Dit was observed suggesting a GeO2 layer formation. Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) measurements suggest that stable and moderately thick GeOX interfacial layer (SPAO was in-between the two high-k layers) provides better immunity to degradation under stress. It was further observed that if GeO2 is at the interface then it degrades at a faster rate. The trap distribution in dielectric layers and interfacial layer properties contribute to the dielectric breakdown. SPAO seems to be an excellent processing step during high-k deposition to enhance the Ge/High-k devices.","","978-1-4673-9719-3","10.1109/ICSICT.2016.7998962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7998962","Equivalent oxide thickness (EOT);SPAO;interface state density (Dit);flat-band voltage shift (Δ VFB);stress induced leakage current (SILC);time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB)","Logic gates;Interface states;High-k dielectric materials;Oxidation;Dielectrics;Plasma temperature","","","","28","IEEE","3 Aug 2017","25-28 Oct. 2016","25-28 Oct. 2016","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple devices transmit complex symbols with a single antenna on distributed, but disjoint OFDM resources. The devices select sufficient frequency resources to enable channel estimation, if the receiver has complete knowledge of the resource map. However, in this scenario the actual allocation map is unknown to the receiver. Therefore, a receiver observing the superposition of all transmitted signals is faced with two problems, channel estimation and identification of the correct resources allocation map. In our previous work [1], we identified the channel and the allocation map of the corresponding users by applying an objective function based on the ℓ1-norm. In this work, we show that successful recovery is possible under different practical ITU channel models. Furthermore, we apply basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) from the compressed sensing framework for channel estimation and show the superior performance in contrast to classical least square estimators. These results show, that identifying non-adjacent multiuser allocations is possible.","1558-2612","978-1-4673-9814-5","10.1109/WCNC.2016.7564854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7564854","resource allocation;sparsity;non-adjacent spectrum;compressed sensing;basis pursuit denoising","Resource management;Receivers;Channel estimation;OFDM;Compressed sensing;Linear programming;Frequency-domain analysis","","","1","23","IEEE","15 Sep 2016","3-6 April 2016","3-6 April 2016","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the distributed nature of access points leads to fragmented information processing, limiting performance in practical deployments. Additionally, existing studies often overlook the impact of limited fronthaul capacity, which introduces noise and degrades the reliability of shared information. In this work, we implement a practical CF-mMIMO prototype under fifth generation new radio standards and propose a diffusion-based uplink scheme that outperforms conventional distributed cell-free systems without cooperation. Our approach adapts to arbitrary fronthaul topologies by leveraging the law of large numbers. We further analyze the linear effects of fronthaul noise and the correlation of uploaded data, demonstrating that the diffusion uplink excels in Rician fading environments while maintaining robust performance in Rayleigh fading. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ a diffusion model for mitigating fronthaul non-idealities, enabling distributed cooperative uplink in a real-world CF-mMIMO system.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2026.3653878","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U25B2007,62371346,62271265); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2024YFC3807900); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11348930","Cell-free;distributed uplink;fronthaul;diffusion model","Uplink;Noise;Channel estimation;Noise reduction;Diffusion models;Topology;Vectors;Decoding;Convolutional neural networks;Central Processing Unit","","","","51","IEEE","13 Jan 2026","2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First of all, three-dimensional modeling technology is the basis for establishing virtual scenes, modeling objects on the stage, including stages, props, and the synthesized video lens movement effect is consistent with the lens parameters of the physical camera to avoid causing the target foreground to “float” the situation on a virtual background. Interaction capabilities are given to some objects, such as the opening of curtains and lights, which can be completed through user interaction. Secondly, introduce the related knowledge of Wuju Opera through some text, pictures and other materials, in order to achieve a deeper understanding of Wuju Opera and the purpose of like Wuju Opera. Finally, by connecting the VRML virtual scene with the database, users can quickly call the corresponding virtual Wuju Opera performance fragments. The VR-Platform platform is used to establish a virtual three-dimensional landscape planning scene, and the roaming function can be realized by making cameras and adding collision detection. By connecting to the database, information can be searched, and the audience can be immersed when roaming by adding music and special effects. The similarity of the characters presented under VR technology is 93%, and the audience’s satisfaction with the drama under VR technology is 95%. The research results show that the visual simulation effect developed based on VR technology has the necessary texture, color, shadow and other changes. It feels the same as the drama on the plane.
