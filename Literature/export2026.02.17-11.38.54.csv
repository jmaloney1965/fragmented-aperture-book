TWA arose directly from antenna concept with an inherent ground plane, while CSA and FA evolved from scattering technology. TWA is much thinner and lighter than CSA and FA, roughly by a factor o 5 and 15, respectively. This study employs an empirical design approach based on the technique of Active Element Gain Pattern (AEGP). Measured data showed TWA's potential for broad bandwidth and wide-angle scan.

However, multiple holes in the difference co-array of the CA cause a loss in DOF and estimation accuracy. This letter presents a super fragmented coprime array (SFCA) configuration, which effectively reconfigures the sensor locations of the existing fragmented coprime design and further increases the inter-subarray spacings. This minimizes the occurrence of holes and enhances the DOF, with the capability of mitigating mutual coupling effects almost identical to the fragmented coprime structure.

And this united information become a new standard to evaluate that probes are or aren't in transcriptional regions. Similar to median method, our method is a way that integrate the information from multiple arrays in the analysis stage rather than the results stage.

This single connection indicates that the antenna is unbalanced and therefore no balun or differential amplifier is required. Additionally, there are no vias required for this unbalanced array, allowing for this concept to be easily scaled to lower or higher frequencies. Further, the fragmented combiner is a PCB-based component, which eliminates the need for traditional commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components e.g. Wilkinson chips for this specific application.

By systematically identifying enriched fragments in therapeutic groups, we are able to extract and focus on few fragments that are likely to be active or structurally important as scaffolds. We show that several therapeutic classes (including antibacterial, antineoplastic, and drugs active on the cardiovascular system, among others) have enriched fragments that are also found in many natural compounds.

The converged lateral acoustic waves are required to break the DNA sample-meniscus inside the tube and the rotational component of acoustic field is used to recirculate the DNA sample to get homogeneous shearing with tight fragment distribution. Finally, we present the experimental results of DNA sheared to different mean fragment sizes using the proposed system and validate the shearing-capability of the proposed system.","","978-1-4577-1846-5","10.1109/ICECS.2011.6122231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122231","","DNA;Transducers;Shearing;Acoustics;RF signals;Arrays;Radio frequency","","1","1","6","IEEE","16 Jan 2012","11-14 Dec. 2011","11-14 Dec. 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article proposes a warhead fragments dispersion parameters' measurement method using the intersection of two light-field cameras and a target damage efficiency assessment calculation method with a multiparameter correlation of warhead fragments dispersion under uncertain information. We research a correlation mechanism between warhead fragments parameters and target damage efficiency. Warhead fragments parameters are combined with the projectile burst location to establish a distribution density function under warhead fragments dispersion with uncertain information. The point trajectory rules of warhead fragments are utilized to set up the spatial position calculation model of warhead fragments hitting the 3-D surface of the target to give the calculation method of the target damage area caused by proximity warhead fragments. The damaged area combined with the damage characteristics of the target itself is used to establish a damage probability calculation model of warhead fragments dispersion to the target under the multi-intersection status of the projectile and target. Simulation analysis reveals the change rule of proximity warhead fragments parameters and target damage efficiency. Experimental results verified the calculation model of target damage efficiency of warhead fragments with uncertain information scientific.

In our model, the binding behavior is affected by two main factors: the concentration of DNA fragments and the binding affinity of one probe with its target and off-target sequences. HMT mainly models the influence of binding affinity and gains the relative short DNA fragment abundance effectively. Results of comparison with another popular method suggest that HMT characterizes the hybridization mechanism of tiling array significantly. Another advantage of our model is that it is based on only one array and therefore can be easily extended to multiple arrays as well as other oligonucleotide array platforms.","","978-1-4244-8304-4","10.1109/BIBMW.2010.5703789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703789","","Probes;Arrays;Bioinformatics;Genomics;Analytical models;Mathematical model;DNA","","","","10","IEEE","28 Jan 2011","18-18 Dec. 2010","18-18 Dec. 2010","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Similar to conventional slab-gel electrophoresis, short DNA molecules have higher migration mobility. However, a “band inversion”-like phenomenon is observed for larger DNA molecules. The pillar array significantly affects the electric field distribution in the separation channel and, consequently, the resulting mobility. Although this leads to a higher mobility in more closely packed pillars, excessive reduction of the pillar spacing generates a large retarding force. This counteracts the effect of electric field on the overall DNA mobility.","1084-6999","978-1-4244-0950-1","10.1109/MEMSYS.2007.4432978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432978","","DNA;Electrokinetics;Fabrication;Mechanical engineering;Microchannel;Fluctuations;Micromechanical devices;Predictive models;Oxidation;Packaging","","3","","10","IEEE","21 Jan 2008","21-25 Jan. 2007","21-25 Jan. 2007","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the high-level representations, sparse array functions are overloaded with Fortran 90 array intrinsic interfaces so that programmers need not be concerned about low-level details. This raises a very interesting optimization problem in the strategies to transform high-level representations to low-level routines by automatic selections and supplies of distribution and compression schemes for sparse arrays.

Power cavitation imaging using a diagnostic phased array synchronized with a FUS-induced BBB opening protocol poses one solution for transcranial cavitation mapping given the minimal focal shift resulting from transcranial ultrasound transmission. 1.94 mm and 1.01 mm average axial and lateral focal shifts, respectively, through primate skulls were observed during in vitro experiments and were recapitulated consistently by simulations.

Such arrays are typically used for sonar, medical diagnosis, and nondestructive testing; however, they have not yet been applied to industrial process analysis. The precise positioning of array elements and high frequencies possible with this technology mean that highly focused images can be generated, which cannot currently be achieved using ultrasound tomography. This article aims to highlight the potential of this technology for the measurement of bubble size distribution (BSD) and to demonstrate its application to both intrusive and noninvasive process measurements. Ultrasound images of bubble reflectors are generated using the total focusing method deployed using a 32-element, 5-MHz linear phased array, and an image processing algorithm for BSD determination is presented and evaluated under stationary and dynamic acquisition conditions. It is found that the sizing accuracy is within 10% for stationary reflectors larger than  $4\lambda $  in diameter and that the algorithm is stable across the expected spatial variation of reflectors. The phased array is coupled to a six-axis robotic arm to scan a solid sample containing bubble reflectors at velocities up to 500 mms−1. The sizing accuracy is within 45% for bubbles larger than  $4\lambda $  in diameter and at velocities up to 300 mms−1. However, above this velocity, the algorithm breaks down for reflectors smaller than  $9\lambda $  in diameter. The ultrasound system is applied to a stream of air bubbles rising through water, which is verified via photographic analysis. Images were generated both intrusive and noninvasive, via a 10-mm Perspex barrier, to the process stream. The high bubble density in the process stream introduced scattering, limiting the measurement repeatability and the sample size in the measured distribution. Notwithstanding, this result demonstrates the potential of this technology to size bubbles for intrusive and noninvasive process analyses.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2972406","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EPM5076471); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8986546","Bubble size distribution (BSD);industrial process analysis;noninvasive imaging;total focusing method (TFM);ultrasound array imaging","Ultrasonic imaging;Acoustics;Phased arrays;Heuristic algorithms;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Optical imaging","Algorithms;Equipment Design;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Chemical;Ultrasonography","11","","31","IEEE","7 Feb 2020","July 2020","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Secret sharing scheme has been proposed as a keyless and resilient mechanism to mitigate this, but scaling through large scale data infrastructure has remained the bane of using secret sharing scheme in big data storage and retrievals. This work applies secret sharing methods as used in cryptography to create robust and secure data storage and retrievals in conjunction with data fragmentation. It outlines two different methods of distributing data equally to storage locations as well as recovering them in such a manner that ensures consistent data availability irrespective of file size and type. Our experiments consist of two different methods — data and key shares. Using our experimental results, we were able to validate previous works on the effects of threshold on file recovery. Results obtained also revealed the varying effects of share writing to and retrieval from storage locations other than computer memory. The implication is that increase in fragment size at varying file and threshold sizes rather than add overheads to file recovery, do so on creation instead, underscoring the importance of choosing a varying fragment size as file size increases.","","978-1-5090-5060-4","10.1109/CyberSA.2017.8073396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8073396","data;key;secret shares;disaster contention;thresholds scheme","Cloud computing;Metadata;Robustness;Encryption;Memory","","","","15","IEEE","19 Oct 2017","19-20 June 2017","19-20 June 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose solutions to address this open problem. We first apply the array operation synthesis (developed for Fortran 90 programs) to HPF programs and demonstrate its performance benefits on distributed-memory machines. In addition, to prevent a situation we call the ""synthesis performance anomaly"", we derive a cost model and present an optimal solution based on this model to guide the array synthesis process on distributed-memory machines. We also show that the optimal problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we develop a practical heuristic algorithm for compilers to devise a synthesis strategy on distributed-memory machines with HPF programs.

Objective: This study aims to demonstrate a pre-planning pipeline consisting of transcranial simulations and in vitro experimentation used to inform synchronous BBB opening and power cavitation imaging (PCI) with a single theranostic ultrasound (TUS) phased array. Methods: Acoustic wave propagation simulation findings of pressure attenuation and focal shift through clinical-CT and micro-CT-based primate skull models were compared, while the latter were used to determine the impact of beam steering angle on focal shift and pressure attenuation. In vitro experimentation with a channel phantom enabled characterization of skull-induced receive focal shift (RFS), while in vivo BBB opening and PCI using in silico and in vitro pre-planning information was conducted using a custom Verasonics/MATLAB script. Results: Simulations confirmed steering angle dependent transcranial focal shift and pressure attenuation, while in vitro experiments revealed minimal (0.30-1.50 mm) skull-induced RFS. In vivo rodent experiments with overlaid primate skull fragments demonstrated successful TUS-mediated BBB opening and spatially correlated power cavitation images (PCI) with regions of BBB opening on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI).

The site was a practice firing range for 105-mm, 155-mm, and 8-inch projectiles. Because of the low density of unexploded rounds, a test area was set up where inert rounds were seeded in an area of exploded clutter. Individual anomaly signatures are fitted to a simple induced dipole response model based on each compact metallic object being characterized by three orthogonal magnetic polarization coefficients along the object's axes of symmetry. We find that a high degree of discrimination between the intact rounds and clusters of exploded fragments is possible based on these model parameters. However, the fit results quickly degrade for anomalies with low signal to noise.","","0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026181","","Testing;Electromagnetic interference;Sensor arrays;Magnetic sensors;Mortar;Position measurement;Global Positioning System;Coils;Pulse measurements;Laboratories","","","","4","IEEE","7 Nov 2002","24-28 June 2002","24-28 June 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The inner dust coma of Comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup: multiple jets and nucleus fragments?","N. McBride; S. F. Green; A. Chantal Levasseur-Regourd; B. Goidet-Devel; J. Renard",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,"19 Jan 2018","1997","289","3","535","553","On 1992 July 10 the European Space Agency's spaceprobe Giotto passed the nucleus of the comparatively inactive comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup at a relative velocity of 14 km s−1. This Giotto Extended Mission (GEM) followed a highly successful encounter in 1986 with Comet lP/Halley. We present results returned from the Optical Probe Experiment (OPE) and in particular consider data gathered by the channels sensitive to the scattering of solar light by cometary dust grains, in emission-free continuum bands. Owing to the demise of the Halley Multicolour Camera (HMC) during the Halley encounter, and the low number of impacts registered by the Dust Impact Detection System (D1DSY), OPE data offer the best indication of the actual encounter geometry. We find that it is likely that Giotto was on the sunward side of the shadow terminator plane at closest approach, with our modelling results suggesting that Giotto passed ~100 km from the nucleus (although distances of up to 300 km cannot be ruled out). We investigate possible causes of the striking ‘spike’ features, or ‘events’, in the OPE data. While scattering of sunlight from ejecta particles as a result of dust impacts on the spacecraft body cannot be ruled out, considerations of the hypervelocity impact mechanisms and impact geometry show that this explanation is not without problems, and more investiga- tion is needed before it can be conclusively accepted. As an alternative solution, we find that the complex data profiles can be fitted by jet activity in the innermost coma (which was not resolvable by ground-based observers). One particular event occurring at least 1000 km from the nucleus can be fitted if the OPE line of sight passes close to a nucleus fragment of radius 10–100 m which is situated around 50 km from the spacecraft and which is producing a small dust coma.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/289.3.535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8134100","instrumentation: detectors;instrumentation: miscellaneous;space vehicles;comets: general;comets: individual: 26P/Grigg;Skjellerup","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","Aug. 1997","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Based on the 3-D coordinates of projectile multiburst location and finite element analysis theory, the calculation method of target vulnerability area was researched and analyzed by dividing the target vulnerable area into many unit areas to develop assessment arithmetic of target damage efficiency. The relationship of fragments size, impact angle, and vulnerable surface unit area size and the calculation methods of the target vulnerable area and damage sensitivity were discussed. The target damage probability was also calculated and analyzed using projectile fragments distribution density, number of fragments, and fragment cloud scattering radius.

They commonly have regular point structure as they are yielded by a prearranged experiment. The description of point dependencies is called approximation. If a modeling object is not substantially linear, the approximation of the entire array by a single model is difficult, especially when the data shows pronounced fractures, discontinuities of the first kind, irregular periodicity, etc. The approximation of such dependencies using known methods, such as polynomial expansions, splicing, etc., faces great difficulties and inaccuracies. Studies have shown the expediency of using a fundamentally new method alternative to the existing one, known as the “Cut-Glue Approximation” method. The method is based on the known, so-called “piecewise” approach, which uses the decomposition of approximated data into fragments that have well-approximated data structures. If the task uses a fragmented data array, then the “Cut-Glue Approximation” method is implemented at three stages: approximation of each fragment by an analytic function, transformation of each function into an interval-isolated fragment, and their additive grouping into a single analytic function. This function is a mathematical model of the dependence under study. The method developed by the authors in this paper is based on a number of mathematical tools that not only provide a regular and effective approach to the high-accuracy approximation of dependencies with any nonlinearities but also optimize the results obtained on each stage. This was made possible thanks to a fundamentally new multiplicative-additive approach to the problem of approximating data with arbitrary dimension. The paper presents the mathematical models of data transformation and describes algorithms for implementing the stages. A clear example shows the results.","","978-1-5386-4938-1","10.1109/RUSAUTOCON.2018.8501639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8501639","experimental data;data fragments;mathematical model;approximation;inaccuracy;optimization;quality criterion;multiplicative selection;additive grouping","Mathematical model;Approximation algorithms;Arrays;Software;Additives;Optimization;Complexity theory","","","","24","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","9-16 Sept. 2018","9-16 Sept. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using double-precision SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instructions simultaneously can handle two packed double-precision floating-point data elements with 128-bit XMM vector registers, which greatly improves floating-point performance. Sometimes non-consecutive data instead of consecutive ones appear in SIMD computation, which prevents SIMD optimization. That is because two non-consecutive double precision floating-point data elements cannot be loaded into 128-bit vector registers simultaneously and they have to be loaded for twice. How to implement SIMD optimization for non-consecutive data is our concern. Loop unrolling exposes the rule and characteristics of such non-consecutive data. Register rotation can help transform non-consecutive data to vector data. Based on a representative kernel program, we illustrate our SIMD optimization combining loop unrolling with register rotation.

It requires repeated intraoperative exposure of the patient and surgical team personnel to x-ray as well as several irrelevant incisions to find the metal fragments. In this article, a noninvasive and safe impedance-based method is proposed to facilitate the identification and localization of the MFR in the body. The biological tissue and MFR buried in it were simulated in the COMSOL software using finite element method (FEM), and its identification capability was checked by measuring the electrical impedance. The bioimpedance sensor was designed and built, and the electrical bioimpedance spectrum was measured for the saline solution containing the steel ball with different diameters and at different depths. The obtained results showed that the magnitude and phase of the bioimpedance spectrum contain useful information to detect spherical steel balls in the depth of the saline solution. Also, to practically detect MFR in real tissues, steel balls with different diameters were placed in the depth of a fresh sheep meat and the bioimpedance spectrum was measured from the surface of the tissue. The results showed that the proposed method can be used as an auxiliary tool to determine the location of the MFR during surgery, therefore eliminates the need for computed tomography (CT) imaging during surgery.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2024.3364070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10438992","Electrical bioimpedance spectrum;finite element model;metal fragment;Nyquist curve;sensitivity;Wenner electrode array","Biological tissues;Electrodes;Surgery;Impedance;Current measurement;Metals;Impedance measurement","","4","","33","IEEE","16 Feb 2024","1 April1, 2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For each type of features, a base model is constructed which ensembles six machine learning algorithms to predict cancer scores for every sample. Then, the cancer scores from six base models are ensembled to generate the final stacked model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the staked ensemble model, it was applied to discriminate samples with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and health controls based on the whole genome bisulfite sequencing data of cfDNAs.

We explore the possibility of observational detection of the fragments in discs viewed through the outflow cavity at a distance of 250 pc. We demonstrate that one hour of integration time with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) is sufficient to detect the fragments with masses as low as 1.5MJup at orbital distances up to 800 au from the protostar. The ALMA resolution sets the limit on the minimum orbital distance of detectable fragments. For the adopted resolution of our simulated ALMA images of 0.1 arcsec, the fragments can be detected at distances down to 50 au. At smaller distances, the fragments usually merge with the central density peak. The likelihood for detecting the fragments reduces significantly for a lower resolution of 0.5 arcsec. Some of the most massive fragments, regardless of their orbital distance, can produce characteristic peaks at ≈ 5 μm and hence their presence can be indirectly inferred from the observed spectral energy distributions of protostars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stt970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8165862","accretion, accretion discs;hydrodynamics;instabilities;stars: formation","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","Aug. 2013","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The DNA copolymer vesicles were prepared using a single emulsion technique. In this procedure, an aqueous solution containing the short fragment DNA is emulsified in toluene and stabilized by the amphiphilic diblock copolymer. The hydrophobic PBd block forms an interfacial brush, while the hydrophilic, cationic P4VPQ block complexes with the negatively charged DNA. When the emulsion droplets are transferred into ethyl acetate, which is a non-solvent for polybutadiene, the PBd brush collapses resulting in the formation of DNA capsules. Two different but related methods were used to produce DNA vesicles, which were stabilized in an aqueous polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution. The first method of preparation resulted in DNA vesicles which were adhered to the surface of a glass slide. This method is useful for in vitro gene delivery. The second method of preparation resulted in mobile DNA vesicles which were suspended in aqueous PEG solution.

One possible solution to offer acceptable bounds for both collection time and space, is to put a limit on object sizes. This solution allows us to calculate the maximal pause time of the collector and the bound of the GC latency.

Many of these drawbacks arise from the standard solid state detectors used so far which can be solved simultaneously by usage of highly segmented single-quantum counting pixel detectors. The Timepix pixel device, which is equipped with energy and time sensitivity capability per pixel, provides high granularity, wide dynamic range and per pixel threshold. This detector operated with integrated USB-readout interfaces such as the USB 1.0 and FITPix devices and the data acquisition software tool Pixelman, both developed for the pixel detectors of the Medipix-family, enables a variety of instrumental configurations, visualization, real-time event-by-event selection as well as vacuum and portability of operation for flexible measurements on different targets and setups. These features combined with event track analysis provide enhanced signal to noise ratio with a high suppression of background and unwanted events. The detector provides multi-parameter information (position, energy and time) for basically all types of ionizing particles in a wide dynamic range of energy (pixel energy threshold ≈ 4 keV), interaction/arrival time (timepix clock step ≥ 100 ns) and position (pixel size = 55 μm). High selectivity is achieved by spatial and time correlation in the same sensor. In addition, several detectors can be run in coincidence. The open and close exposition (shutter) time as well as the readout DAQ can be fully synchronized. For this purpose, we have assembled a modular multi-parameter, tunable and extendable coincidence detector array system based on two and more Timepix devices which can be coupled with supplementary detectors (solid state ΔE detectors and/or ionization chambers) for enhanced ion selectivity. We describe the individual configurations and techniques together with the experiments carried out at several neutron beam/source facilities.

Previously, we reported an adaptive nonlinear visualization system based on a complex-valued self-organizing map (CSOM) that deals with complex amplitude texture in reflection images at multiple frequencies. The system distinguishes landmines from clutter by paying attention to textural features obtained by high spatial resolution and wideband reflection measurement. Because the system employed a mechanical scan of a pair of horn antennas, the measurement required a long time. An array antenna can reduce the time. The antenna element to be used there should therefore be compact and wideband. This paper reports the design and fabrication of a walled LTSA array visualization system. The antenna element has a 14 times 28 mm aperture size, and works at the 8-12 GHz frequency band. Because the structure is a simple combination of glass epoxy substrates and metal plates, we can easily fabricate low-cost and lightweight arrays. Electrical switches realize a high-speed scanning of 12 times 12 = 144 elements in total. We also report the results of a visualization experiment, in which plastic landmines are clearly visualized with the array in combination with the adaptive CSOM processing. Detection of landmines at frequencies of 10 GHz is only likely to be possible for targets buried a few centimeter deep or where the soil attenuation is very low. This might be a severe limitation of applicability of the method, as in field conditions soil attenuations of 10 dB or considerably more are commonly encountered, requiring the radar to operate at frequencies below 2-3 GHz. The best solution may be a multisensor system comprising these complementary high- and low-frequency radars.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.897418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276893","Complex-valued self-organizing map (CSOM);ground-penetrating radar (GPR);linearly tapered slot antenna (LTSA);plastic landmine","Phased arrays;Spatial resolution;High-resolution imaging;Visualization;Plastics;Landmine detection;Frequency;Linear antenna arrays;Optical reflection;Antenna measurements","","47","","22","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Designing DNA fragments that meet specific requirements is crucial for ensuring the smooth execution of tasks in these domains. However, the conventional approach of combining constraints with evolutionary algorithms often encounters challenges like orthogonality and thermodynamic instability. This poses risks to the control of reaction processes. To tackle these challenges, we have undertaken two tasks in this study: expanding constraint sets and innovating evolutionary algorithms. Firstly, we propose a base balance strategy aimed at enhancing the thermodynamic properties within DNA fragment groups by diversifying neighboring base combinations. The addition of this strategy achieves a minimum variance of 0.03 for the melting temperature while ensuring orthogonality. It represents a significant improvement compared to previous results and reduces the complexity of controlling reactions. Secondly, our static virus spread algorithm optimizes target DNA fragments by base mutations and virus amplification. Simultaneously,it demonstrates good performance across 23 benchmark functions, highlighting its optimization potential. This work is expected to further refine theoretical shortcomings and offer a convenient tool for DNA fragment optimization.","2156-1133","979-8-3503-8622-6","10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10821960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10821960","DNA fragment optimization;base balance;static virus spread algorithm;evolution;DNA computing","Thermodynamics;Computer viruses;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;DNA;Evolutionary computation;Stability analysis;Optimization;Viruses (medical);DNA computing","","","","37","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","3-6 Dec. 2024","3-6 Dec. 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lauren","Gene Logic, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA",IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience,"8 Sep 2003","2003","2","3","163","170","DNA microarrays are powerful tools for quantifying gene expression patterns. However, obtaining reliable estimates of gene expression from raw measurements on microarrays presents several problems due to background contributions, nonspecific probe response, possible variation in probe sensitivities, and possible nonlinear responses of the probes to transcript concentration. In an effort to address the nonspecific response of probes, Affymetrix GeneChip arrays use two probes for each measurement. One of these probes, the mismatch (MM) probe, is intended to reflect the nonspecific response of the corresponding perfect match (PM) probe. However, the reliability of this approach has not been established by published experiments. Indeed, some research has shown that at high transcript concentrations, the nonspecific component of the PM signal is a negligible part of the MM signal. Five variations of a method to model and estimate levels of gene expression on Affymetrix chips, without the use of MM cells, are presented. To test the validity of the algorithms, six different concentrations of human liver cRNA were prepared. Each of these solutions was then hybridized on five Affymetrix hg95A arrays using five different scanners. The expression estimates obtained using each of the five algorithms bore a strong linear relationship to the cRNA concentrations, particularly at low cRNA concentrations. The five variations were applied to a Latin square data set and the results compared with those obtained using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 and using robust multichip analysis. R/sup 2/ values obtained using the new techniques were comparable, while fold changes were superior.","1558-2639","","10.1109/TNB.2003.817020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1229601","","Gene expression;Probes;Biomedical measurements;Signal processing algorithms;Humans;Brightness;Noise measurement;Voting;Semiconductor device measurement;Testing","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;DNA;Gene Expression Profiling;Models, Genetic;Molecular Probes;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","5","1","12","IEEE","8 Sep 2003","Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Array regrouping and its use in compiling data-intensive, embedded applications","V. De La Luz; M. Kandemir","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Computers,"14 Jun 2004","2004","53","1","1","19","One of the key challenges facing computer architects and compiler writers is the increasing discrepancy between processor cycle times and main memory access times. To alleviate this problem in array-intensive embedded signal and video processing applications, compilers may employ either control-centric transformations that change data access patterns of nested loops or data-centric transformations that modify memory layouts of multidimensional arrays. Most of the memory layout optimizations proposed so far either modify the layout of each array independently or are based on explicit data reorganizations at runtime. We focus on a compiler technique, called array regrouping, that automatically maps multiple arrays into a single data (array) space to improve data access pattern. We present a mathematical framework that enables us to systematically derive suitable mappings for a given array-intensive embedded application. The framework divides the arrays accessed in a given program into several groups and each group is independently layout-transformed to improve spatial locality and reduce the number of conflict misses. As compared to the previous approaches, the proposed technique makes two new contributions: 1) It presents a graph based formulation of the array regrouping problem and 2) it demonstrates potential benefits of this aggressive array-regrouping strategy in optimizing behavior of embedded systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in cache miss rates and execution times. An important advantage of this approach over the previous techniques that target conflict misses is that it reduces conflict misses without increasing the data space requirements of the application being optimized. This is a very desirable property in many embedded/portable environments where data space requirements determine the minimum physical memory capacity. In addition to performance related issues, with the increased use of embedded/portable devices, improving energy efficiency of applications is becoming a critical issue. To develop a truly energy-efficient system, energy constraints should be taken into account early in the design process, i.e., at the source level in software compilation and behavioral level in hardware compilation. Source-level optimizations are particularly important in data-dominated media applications. We also show how our array regrouping strategy increases energy savings from using multiple low-power operating modes provided in current memory modules. Using a set of array-intensive benchmarks, we observe significant savings in memory system energy.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2004.1255787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255787","","Cache memories;Memory architecture;Program control structures","","9","","53","IEEE","14 Jun 2004","Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Challenges associated with phased arrays, such as high electrical impedance and element breakdown at high voltages, were addressed in the previous study, and a high-power 64-element transducer module was designed and fabricated. In this study, a cylindrical array of 16 modules with the frequency of 260 kHz was modeled and constructed for DVT thrombolysis. The maximum pressure, focal size, and steering ability of the array were examined. In vitro experiments were conducted to assess the performance of the array. The simulated pressure amplitude of 34 MPa at the depth of 55 mm (average femoral vein (FV) distance from the inner surface of the thigh) was in consistent with the experiments and satisfied the purpose of this study. Moreover, the employed module distribution resulted in a focal spot dimension of  $2.4\times 2.8\times7.3$  mm3 (at the 75% pressure amplitude level) that can be confined in a human FV with the average diameter of 12 mm. In vitro experiments manifested a partial and complete clot breakdown at 11.5- and 15-MPa pressure at the focus.

The sensor is first validated for pH static and dynamic sensing, showing near-ideal characteristics, recommending it for the continuous monitoring of proteins in their physiological range. The system shows an excellent stability thanks to a reference subtracted operational mode, with a current sensitivity to CRP up to 1.2nA/decade on a wide concentration range between $0.6\mu \mathrm{g}/\text{ml}$ and $100\mu \mathrm{g}/\text{ml}$ (corresponding to typical CRP concentration ranges in blood), while operated in a pseudo-super-Nernstian back-gate configuration. The calculated limit-of-detection (LoD) is $0.73\mu \mathrm{g}/\text{ml}$. The sensor response is characterized by a great stability over time, showing a drift lower than 3pA/minute in the optimal bias condition, and a hysteresis lower than 300mV. The sensor offers some of the best ever reported performance tradeoffs in fully integrated sensors. The selectivity is enhanced by using specific CRP antibodies Fab fragments, reducing the overall thickness of the sensing functionalization, but preserving the binding sites. Thus, the sensor is more resilient to the Debye screening in ionic solutions, resulting in a detectable perturbation of the SiNWs array output current. The high surface-to-volume ratio of the SiNWs structures, together with a signal amplification and signal-to-noise ratio obtained with a double-gate configuration makes the reported system an excellent candidate for an integrated wearable FET -based multi-marker sensor platform, able to continuously monitor inflammation biomarkers in serum and interstitial fluid.","2156-017X","978-1-6654-2572-8","10.1109/IEDM19574.2021.9720670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9720670","","Proteins;Sensitivity;Field effect transistors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Silicon;Real-time systems;Sensors","","3","","6","IEEE","9 Mar 2022","11-16 Dec. 2021","11-16 Dec. 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, there is a need of deploying tools to detect low-density plastic, rubber, wood and glass that are unlikely to be detected by X-Rays, currently used in the most powerful commercial systems. To this end, we propose a microwave-based device, exploiting the dielectric contrast between potential intrusions (e.g., plastic fragments) and the surrounding medium, represented by the food/beverage product. In particular, this work aims to numerically assess this principle of detection to water-based products that are, due to the medium losses, a challenging category at microwaves. An antennas array surrounds the object moving along the production line, to monitor the electromagnetic signal variations with respect to a reference case. The working frequency is chosen by selecting a proper trade-off between penetration depth and image resolution. Then, a procedure, based on the application of the distorted-Born approximation is applied to reconstruct a 3- D image of the contaminant position. Finally, the successful detection of a millimetric-sized plastic sphere is presented in the case of a common commercial bottle filled with water.","","978-88-31299-04-6","10.23919/EuCAP53622.2022.9769610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9769610","microwave imaging;non-invasive diagnostics;food inspection;food security;food safety","Microwave antennas;Microwave devices;X-rays;Microwave antenna arrays;Food products;Safety;Plastics","","3","","12","","11 May 2022","27 March-1 April 2022","27 March-1 April 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This problem is particularly severe when imaging through strongly aberrating layers, such as the human skull, where the complex geometry and heterogeneous acoustic properties introduce large, spatially varying distortions. Estimating the underlying tissue sound speed enables more effective aberration correction, and recent advances in reconstructing sound speed maps from ultrasound signals have opened new possibilities for distributed correction strategies. However, different aberration correction approaches involve important trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and practical feasibility. In this numerical study, we systematically compared three representative correction methods: Eikonal-based travel time estimation, full-wave simulation, and time reversal. Acoustic property maps were derived from micro-CT scans of ex vivo human skulls. A phased array was simulated to focus at 30 mm through the skull, and corrections were applied using the three approaches. Without the skull, the targeted focal depth was achieved with a lateral full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1.8 mm, whereas with the skull and no correction, the focus shifted and beam quality degraded. All three correction strategies effectively reduced distortion. Eikonal correction restored the focus efficiently (0.5 seconds) but generated higher side lobes and a wider FWHM of 3.1 mm. Full-wave correction provided improved sharpness (FWHM = 2.5 mm) but required longer computation (2 minutes). Time reversal achieved the best focus (FWHM = 1.7 mm) but required complete waveform modification, limiting its experimental practicality. Overall, the results demonstrate clear trade-offs between computational efficiency and correction performance.","1948-5727","979-8-3315-2332-9","10.1109/IUS62464.2025.11201782","National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11201782","aberration correction;transcranial ultrasound;ultrasound simulations;speed of sound;beamforming","Phased arrays;Ultrasonic imaging;Acoustic distortion;Accuracy;Limiting;Numerical analysis;Acoustics;Computational efficiency;Acoustic beams;Phase distortion","","","","23","IEEE","20 Oct 2025","15-18 Sept. 2025","15-18 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Genetic diagnostics are powerful technology drivers and excellent candidate applications for miniaturization technologies because the demand for inexpensive genetic information is essentially unlimited, and the cost and time for the diagnostic decreases with sample volume. Genetic information is stored in long DNA molecules in solution. This information is processed and extracted using a series of enzymatic and other chemical reactions well known in molecular biology. Processing of DNA molecules in the microscale hence requires the implementation of microfluidic devices capable of handling, mixing, thermal cycling, separating, and detecting nano- and picoliter liquid samples. This paper discusses some of the fundamental macroscale protocols used for genetic analyses and how these processes scale down to microscopic volumes. The construction and performance of microfluidic devices of DNA amplification, separation, hybridization, and detection are discussed, showing that so far, no fundamental impediments exist for genetic diagnostics based on microelectromechanical systems. Some of the unresolved storage and packaging issues and future challenges for the practical implementation of these devices are also presented.","1558-2256","","10.1109/5.704282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=704282","","Genetics;DNA;Microfluidics;Chemical technology;Costs;Data mining;Chemical processes;Nanoscale devices;Nanobioscience;Protocols","","117","45","147","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","Aug. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we propose two in-house built 32-element cavitation monitoring transducers for 3D passive acoustic mapping (PAM) with fixed co-registration. Based on previously in-house developed therapy matrix arrays, two different design approaches are used, one being an add-on transducer for a preclinical array and the other one being the integration of elements into the transmit aperture of a clinical array. For the experimental validation in the preclinical setup, the therapy transducer excited a microbubble solution flowing through a tube and the emissions were simultaneously recorded by the add-on transducer (1 mm elements, 4 MHz). For the clinical setup with the integrated elements (2 mm, 1 MHz), the cavitation was generated by a separate single-element focused transducer. For both design approaches, 3D PAM was successfully validated, with the experimental full width at half maximum values being in good agreement with the numerical ones. Additionally, the detection of cavitation signals through an ex vivo skull fragment was shown for the clinical design. For the integrated elements, cross coupling remains an issue which needs to be solved to enable monitoring during therapy pulses.","1948-5727","979-8-3315-2332-9","10.1109/IUS62464.2025.11201758","Horizon Europe; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11201758","cavitation monitoring;3D passive acoustic mapping;theranostic transducer;transcranial ultrasound","Couplings;Transducers;Three-dimensional displays;Ultrasonic imaging;Medical treatment;Apertures;Acoustics;Monitoring","","","","23","IEEE","20 Oct 2025","15-18 Sept. 2025","15-18 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we demonstrate the methodology through case studies implementing non-trivial distributed kernels -- both regular and irregular -- from the NAS parallel benchmarks.

The sequences were determined by either cloning-sequencing of SELX fragments (SELEX-clos) or high-density microarray (tilling array) analysis (SELEX-chip). Here we describe the application of these novel technologies for search of the whole set of regulation target genes on the E. coli genome by CRP (cAMP-binding protein).","","978-1-4244-5094-7","10.1109/MHS.2009.5351954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5351954","","Genomics;Bioinformatics;RNA;Polymers;Isolation technology;DNA;Sequences;Target recognition;System testing;Proteins","","2","","15","IEEE","11 Dec 2009","9-11 Nov. 2009","9-11 Nov. 2009","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proceedings.","26 Mar 2003","2003","","","201","205","In order to sequence a target DNA, it is first cleaved into many shorter overlapping fragments by chemical or physical techniques. The nucleotide sequence of each fragment is then determined (read) by established methods. The set of all read fragments which cover the target DNA sequence is called its spectrum. It is believed that the shortest superstring of a spectrum is the best candidate for the target DNA sequence. The general problem of finding the shortest superstring for any given set of strings s is NP-hard. Fortunately, the biological instance of this problem is easier. It is not likely that two read fragments, each consisting of several hundred letters, which come from consecutive locations on the target DNA sequence have an overlap of only a few letters; typically, the overlap will be longer. Thus one may reasonably assume that two strings in the spectrum have significant overlap (connectivity) if they come from consecutive locations on the target DNA sequence. A class of important instances satisfying this assumption are those whose spectra are from DNA microarrays. This assumption allows us to claim and show the following: if the spectrum S of a target DNA sequence is substring-free and connected at level t, and the target DNA sequence has no repeats of size t or larger, then there exists an algorithm to reconstruct the target DNA sequence in the linear time O(|S|) after an overlap graph of the spectrum is built.","","0-7695-1907-5","10.1109/BIBE.2003.1188947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188947","","DNA;Sequences;Biomedical engineering;Assembly;Approximation algorithms;Computer science;Chemical engineering;Polymers;Bioinformatics","","","","9","IEEE","26 Mar 2003","12-12 March 2003","12-12 March 2003","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pure geometrical contribution to the matrix elements can easily be approximated by the length of intersection between detected lines of response (LOR) and individual voxels. However, the natural observables are volume-based, i.e. the coincidence rates which are usually detected in tubes of response (TOR) as well as the activity concentration in each voxel refer to specific spatial fragments. Therefore, we developed a fast method for the analytical calculation of the 3D shape and volume of intersection polyhedrons to build the system matrix with an improved description of the geometrical detection probability. Additionally, we considered effects of detector blurring within the system matrix. Gaussian resolution functions have been assumed in the radial and axial direction describing migrations between adjacent TORs. Finally, exploiting intrinsic symmetry relations and the sparseness of the system matrix allowed to create an efficiently small matrix representation which could be pre-computed and completely stored in memory. Time-consuming voxel addressing calculations due to necessary symmetry operations have been completely avoided by using an octant-wise symmetrically ordered field of voxels. The above algorithm has been applied for an iterative, fully 3D reconstruction (MLEM/OSEM) of pre-corrected 3D sinograms provided by a Siemens/CTI HR+PET scanner. A comparison about the results with other established reconstruction platforms is given where our analytical volume-based approach yields a superior contrast behaviour at a lower level of noise.","1082-3654","0-7803-8701-5","10.1109/NSSMIC.2004.1462763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1462763","","Positron emission tomography;Image reconstruction;Probability;Detectors;Algorithm design and analysis;Iterative algorithms;Symmetric matrices;Surface reconstruction;Shape;Spatial resolution","","2","","2","IEEE","1 Aug 2005","16-22 Oct. 2004","16-22 Oct. 2004","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A step in compositing deep images requires merging per-pixel fragment lists in depth order; little work has so far been presented on fast approaches. This paper explores GPU based merging of deep images using different memory layouts for fragment lists: linked lists, linearised arrays, and interleaved arrays. We also report performance improvements using techniques which leverage GPU memory hierarchy by processing blocks of fragment data using fast registers, following similar techniques used to improve performance of transparency rendering. We report results for compositing from two deep images or saving the resulting deep image before compositing, as well as for an iterated pairwise merge of multiple deep images.

Using 4 different processors and two simple tests, we demonstrate that a number of random reads and writes in an array can have a penalty factor of 40-70 compared to the exact same number of sequential array accesses. These effects from cache misses first occur when a randomly accessed array is larger than the L1 cache and even more so when the array does not fit in the much larger L2 cache. A similar but much smaller effect between sequential reads and writes in large arrays compared with smaller arrays is also reported. In the second part of this paper three versions of the well known Radix algorithm is used to demonstrate that the 'artificial' results from the first part definitely occur in practice. These versions use one, two and three digits, and hence one, two or three full passes to sort an array. For small arrays the two and three digit Radix algorithms of course are much slower than the one digit version, but for larger arrays the former outperform the latter. For comparison, the radix sorting execution times are compared to Quicksort and Flashsort, a different one-digit sorting algorithm, both of which are outperformed by the two and three digit Radix algorithms. Finally, a simple model based on the penalty of cache misses is introduced, and we use this model to explain the demonstrated differences in algorithmic efficiency.","","0-7695-2937-2","10.1109/ICSEA.2007.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299915","caches;cache models;cache friendly algorithms;radix;sorting","Sorting;Informatics;Sequential analysis;Testing;Performance evaluation;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Bridges;Cache memory","","1","","15","IEEE","10 Sep 2007","25-31 Aug. 2007","25-31 Aug. 2007","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The tool provides the basic functionality of a traditional preprocessor where directives are embedded in a serial Fortran program and interpreted by the preprocessor to produce parallel Fortran code with MPI calls. The unique aspect of this work is that the user can make additions to, or modify, these directives. The directives reside in a preprocessor library and changes to this library can range from small changes to customize an existing library, to larger changes for porting a library, to completely replacing the library. The preprocessor is programmed with a library of directives written in a C-like language, called DL, that has added support for manipulating Fortran code fragments. The primary benefits to the user are twofold: It is fairly easy for any user to generate efficient, parallel code from Fortran-90 with embedded directives, and the long term viability of the user’s software is guaranteed. This is because the source code will always run on a serial machine (the directives are transparent to standard Fortran compilers), and the preprocessor library can be modified to work with different hardware and software environments. A 4000 line preprocessor library has been written and used to parallelize roughly 50,000 lines of groundwater modeling code. The programs have been ported to a wide range of parallel architectures. Performance of these programs is similar to programs explicitly written for a parallel machine. Binaries of the preprocessor core, as well as the preprocessor library source code used in our groundwater modeling codes are currently available.","","1-58113-091-0","10.1145/331532.331535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592646","","Parallel programming;Computer architecture;Parallel processing;Software libraries;Parallel machines;Message passing;Laboratories;Embedded software;Code standards;Software standards","","1","2","5","IEEE","13 Feb 2006","13-19 Nov. 1999","13-19 Nov. 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To do so, and in order to compare the model with experimental results, it was decided to focus on the modeling of an output pulse height spectrum (also known as PHA spectrum). The physical modeling of the fission chamber comes in two parts in order to finally obtain proper equations describing the PHA spectrum. In a first phase, we have considered that fission reactions occurred at a random area in the fissile deposit. From there, the first step was to calculate, for each initial energy value of the fission fragment, its distribution in energy when released in the filling gas of the detector. To achieve this, a few assumptions were made: the equiprobability of the location of the fission in the deposit, the absence of imperfections in the deposit which is supposed to be perfectly flat (this point is probably the most open to discussions) and the isotropy of the fission fragment emission angle distribution. The energy deposition mechanism in the deposit was simulated using the SRIM software. At the end, comparisons with experimental data were made. Results were encouraging although they revealed differences in the high energy area. In order to solve this problem, the mechanism of the energy deposition in the gas must be taken into account. This second phase used the energy distribution of fission fragments at the surface of the deposit calculated in the first phase, in order to determine the energy distribution of fragments available for gas ionization. Again, it necessitated assumptions such as the equiprobability of the fission fragment emission angle from the deposit. In addition, several different filling gases were considered. One more, all calculations were achieved thanks to the SRIM software. This work gave so far very promising results and also provided some perspectives which are detailed in the paper.","","978-1-4577-0927-2","10.1109/ANIMMA.2011.6172896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172896","","Detectors;Filling;Mathematical models;Neutrons;Preamplifiers;Spectroscopy;Noise;Anodes;Trajectory;Titanium","","2","","3","IEEE","3 Apr 2012","6-9 June 2011","6-9 June 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this phase the targets analytes (i.e., DNA fragments) bind to the capturing probes on the array and supposedly reach a steady state. Accordingly, microarray experiments essentially provide only a single, steady-state data point of the hybridization process. On the other hand, a novel technique (i.e., realtime microarrays) capable of recording the kinetics of hybridization in fluorescent-based microarrays has recently been proposed in [5]. The richness of the information obtained therein promises higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller estimation error, and broader assay detection dynamic range compared to the conventional microarrays. In the current paper, we develop a probabilistic model of the kinetics of hybridization and describe a procedure for the estimation of its parameters which include the binding rate and target concentration. This probabilistic model is an important step towards developing optimal detection algorithms for the microarrays which measure the kinetics of hybridization, and to understanding their fundamental limitations.","2150-301X","978-1-4244-0998-3","10.1109/GENSIPS.2007.4365828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365828","","Kinetic theory;Fluorescence;Phased arrays;Steady-state;DNA;Probes;Signal to noise ratio;Estimation error;Dynamic range;Parameter estimation","","2","","10","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","10-12 June 2007","10-12 June 2007","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider the family of fragment and replicate join algorithms that facilitates non-equijoin evaluation and adapt it in a Smart Disk environment. We use Smart Disk as an umbrella term for a variety of different storage devices featuring an embedded processor that may offload data processing from the main CPU. Our approach partially replicates one of the join relations in order to harness all processing capacity in the system. However, partial replication introduces problems with synchronizing concurrent algorithmic steps, load balancing, and selection among different join evaluation alternatives.We use a processing model to avoid performance pitfalls and autonomously select algorithm parameters.

The RNA polymerase core enzyme binds to one of seven sigma factors to form the holoezyme, which recognizes a specific promoter. Furthermore, the promoter recognition of RNA polymerase is modulated by DNA-binding transcription factors. From E. coli K-12 genome sequence, a total of about 300 species of transcription factor are predicted. In order to understand the global regulation of E. coli genome, it is essential to identify the set of promoter recognized by each of all these transcription factors.

A 2-D equalizer, which is the heart of ARMR signal processing, acts to electronically steer the array-reader to provide optimum signal pickup from the track to result in better error-rate performance. To realize this enhanced performance, the 2-D equalizer should be matched to the reader location on the track, which cannot be guaranteed in practice due to track misregistration (TMR) arising from the servo control system. To mitigate this, we present an electronic servoing scheme that estimates the location of the dual-reader on a per-fragment basis and uses this to transform the reference equalizer to a new equalizer that is matched to the estimated location, hence, the name TMR sensitive equalization.

Its extensible instruction set uses sequential control flow in code fragments of up to 64 RISC-like instructions, which encode control and dataflow graphs in adjacency lists. Combined with dedicated, uniform processing elements, this enables fast compilation from C source code (1.4 s mean compile time). Demonstrator measurements reveal energy efficiency of up to 601 int32 MIPS/mW at 0.59V and performance of up to 148 MIPS at 0.90 V. Compared to a RISC reference system, mean energy efficiency is improved by 2.24× with 1.71× higher execution times across 12 of 14 benchmarks. Program-dependent factors underlying variations in energy efficiency are identified using dynamic program analysis. To reduce operand transfer energy, seven interconnect topologies are evaluated: a flat bus, five crossbar variants and a logarithmic network. Best results are obtained for a crossbar topology, reducing mean dynamic tile energy by 19 %. Furthermore, floating-point (FP) support is added to the instruction set and evaluated using three binary-compatible microarchitectures, presenting distinct area-performance-energy tradeoffs.

The orthogonal array plays an important role to create a group of tentative plans more efficiently than heuristics that is commonly used in standard onboard planning applications. The key idea to implement the proposing mission replanning software is the expression of an operational plan by a ""script"". Most spacecraft mission plans are defined as a sequence of system-built-in commands, whereas this ""script"" contains not only the usual plans but also ""logic"" type commands. The logic type command is expressed in a form of a program fragment such as ""IF A THEN DO B"". To make a further discussion on the proposing idea, this paper also shows a result of an experiment using an autonomous underwater vehicle. The onboard software is based on the proposing software architecture and the replanning algorithm to demonstrate its feasibility in an actual circumstance.","","978-1-4577-0713-1","10.1109/SMC-IT.2011.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007774","onboard planning;orthogonal array design;selp-update capability;script engine;onboard autonomy","Information technology;Space missions","","1","","7","IEEE","1 Sep 2011","2-4 Aug. 2011","2-4 Aug. 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the available spaces are segmented into fragmented pieces by the electronic components inside the terminal. This article addresses the problem of how to utilize these fragmented spaces efficiently. A novel miniaturized wideband antenna strategy called distributed mobile antennas is proposed and the distributed two-element antennas are introduced. By assigning a 90° phase difference, the reflections looking toward these two antennas are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, leading to reflection cancellation. Therefore, wideband matching can be achieved and the bandwidth can be further improved by introducing the degree of freedom of the element size consistency. When the proposed strategy is applied to a normal patch, the measured results show that the impedance bandwidths are improved by  $3.6\times $  and  $4.6\times $  for the identical and dissimilar patch cases, respectively. When applied to a miniaturized patch, the bandwidths are improved by  $6.0\times $  and  $6.9\times $ . Moreover, due to the dispersion of hotspots by distributed two-element antennas, the specific absorption rate (SAR) achieves great average reductions of 1.4–2.4 dB. The proposed wideband strategy has great potential for applications in modern 5G mobile terminals.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3433530","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101427,U22BB2016); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3900102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10618984","Distributed mobile antennas;low-profile antennas;miniaturized antennas;wideband antennas","Antenna arrays;Mobile antennas;Antennas;Impedance;Broadband antennas;Reflection;Reflector antennas","","15","","49","IEEE","31 Jul 2024","Sept. 2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We demonstrate that the speedup of these partitioning methods, relative to that of TCAD-assisted full-array capacitance extraction method, can be as high as 17×, with an average of 3×. On the other hand, the error in capacitance derived using the partitioning methods can be as low as 1.01%, with an average of 4.93%.

The objective of our optimization strategy is to determine storage forms for array-based data sets taking into account future use of data (future access patterns). To tackle this problem, we present a three-step strategy: (i) determining all I/O access patterns to the array, and among them, selecting the most dominant (i.e., the most beneficial) access pattern; (ii) determining the most suitable storage form for the array taking into account the most dominant access pattern detected in the previous step; and (iii) optimizing the non-dominant access patterns using collective I/O, an optimization that allows each processor to do I/O on behalf of others if doing so improves overall performance.","","0-7695-1573-8","10.1109/IPDPS.2002.1015492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1015492","","Optimizing compilers;Technological innovation;Computer science;Electronic switching systems;Read only memory;Communications technology;Software performance;Runtime library;File systems;Application software","","1","","25","IEEE","27 Aug 2015","15-19 April 2002","15-19 April 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The presence of clone is known as bad smell, which is phenomena of source code to be refactored. A motivation of refactoring (merging) clones is to reduce the size of source code. An existing study proposed a technique to estimate reduced lines of code by merging clones; however, there are two issues in the existing technique: (1) the existing technique does not consider the refactorability of clones in spite that it is difficult or even impossible to merge some clones due to the limitation of programming languages; (2) in the case that multiple clones are overlapping, the existing technique only considers one of them can be merged. Due to the above issues, estimated reducible LoC is occasionally different from the actual number. Consequently, in this research, we propose a new technique to calculate a reducible LoC. The proposed technique is free from the two issues, and it calculates a reducible LoC fully automatically. The proposed technique performs a loop processing of (a) detecting clones, (b) merging them, (c) compiling the edited source files, and (d) testing them. After finishing the loop, reducible LoC is calculated from the edited source files. This paper also includes comparison results of the proposed technique and the existing one. In the comparisons, we confirmed that a reducible LoC which was calculated with considering refactorability is 25% of a reducible LoC which was estimated without considering refactorability. We also confirmed that the proposed technique was able to merge clones that were not counted in the existing technique.","2640-0715","978-1-7281-4648-5","10.1109/APSEC48747.2019.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945738","Software maintenance;code clone;refactoring","Cloning;Merging;Computer languages;Maintenance engineering;Tools;Testing;Software systems","","2","","17","IEEE","2 Jan 2020","2-5 Dec. 2019","2-5 Dec. 2019","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Programmers often use that definition to access the same memory via variables of different types. For many real programs this practice makes changing the layout of an array impossible without violating the semantics of the program since the same memory block may be accessed via variables of different types-such accesses may now receive wrong array elements. On the other hand, changing array layout is often necessary to obtain good parallel performance or even to improve sequential performance by providing better cache locality. The paper demonstrates that the problem of changing array layouts in the presence of multiple variables of different types accessing the same memory can be solved with the algorithms for 1) detecting overlapping arrays, 2) using procedure cloning to reduce overlapping, 3) array-type coercion, and 4) code structure recovery.","","0-8186-8090-3","10.1109/PACT.1997.644011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=644011","","Computer languages;Computer science;Cloning;Parallel machines;Optimizing compilers;Program processors;Manuals;Performance analysis","","3","1","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","10-14 Nov. 1997","10-14 Nov. 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed fragmented antenna system is intended for a swarm of small unmanned aerial vehicles in a linear flight formation. Inductively end-loaded folded dipole antennas are used as radiating elements. The small antennas are designed so that they can individually radiate with small bandwidth when isolated. The overall dimensions and the total mass of these fabricated elements are  $12 \times 10\times 10$  cm ( $0.096\lambda _{0}\times 0.08\lambda _{0}\times 0.08\lambda _{0}$  at 240 MHz) and 18 g (including the matching network), respectively. Each miniaturized antenna can only provide 2.4 MHz (~1%) bandwidth and  $25~\Omega $  input impedance. Having proper electromagnetic coupling between a cluster of three of such elements, measurement results demonstrate that the middle element can provide 18.4 MHz bandwidth (7.7%, 7.7 fold improvement) and  $126~\Omega $  input impedance when the other two elements are loaded with optimal reactive elements. Moreover, the proposed configuration shows 1 dB gain improvement at boresight direction. The effects of flight formation fluctuations on the coupled antennas are also investigated, and it is shown that as the separation distance between the coupled antennas increases, the input impedance and bandwidth enhancement decrease. To overcome this problem, a tunable matching circuit containing a single varactor is proposed. Measurement results are shown to be in good agreement with the simulation predictions.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2018.2806397","U.S. Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-12-R-0012-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292882","Antenna miniaturization;bandwidth enhancement;coupled antenna array;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted antenna","Dipole antennas;Bandwidth;Couplings;Impedance;Loaded antennas;Antenna arrays","","10","","28","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","April 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This feature is especially useful in the field of real-time programming, where the determinism for memory cache accesses is a limiting factor. In order to do that, we propose an object layout which splits objects into the same sized blocks; in this way, each cache memory line supports a block.

Previously, existing work do not report a software framework to solve a problem with such general cases. In addition, our expression-rewriting framework is based on a new representative form, CSD (common-stride descriptor), to describe the regularity of the access patterns of HPF programs with ""Block-Cyclic"" distribution.

However, modules of circuits to be executed on FPGAs are placed within rectangular reconfigurable regions (RRs) with current floorplanners, leading to internal fragments, and lower utilization of resources. To address this, a dynamic description model of RRs and the corresponding floorplanner named dynamic union partial reconfiguration floorplan (DUPRFloor) are proposed in this article. The RR dynamic description modeling adds an anchor within a rectangular RR to reduce internal fragments. In this way, the modeling can represent both rectangular and nonrectangular shapes. Then, to find the optimal anchor, a clipping method is devised by constraining width and height of the candidate region. Finally, the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is used to optimize an objective function which considers the resources utilization and communication costs to obtain a desirable floorplanning result. The proposed method has been validated by simulation on three kinds of devices. And experimental results show that reconfigurable resources can be saved as much as 19.16% compared to rectangular modeling method. The DUPRFloor is also validated on the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina standard benchmark data sets. Results show that DUPRFloor can reduce 18.65% global wire length at most with almost the same execution time compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Our approach is tested on a FPGA implemented software-defined radio (SDR) and reduced 29.41% wasted configurable frames, and to the overall design, 2% configurable frames are saved at most.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2020.3022345","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1001701); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672423); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9187912","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA);floorplan;mixed-integer linear programming (MILP);partial reconfiguration;reconfigurable computing","Field programmable gate arrays;Fabrics;Heuristic algorithms;Integrated circuit modeling;Shape;Partitioning algorithms;Wires","","3","","35","IEEE","8 Sep 2020","Aug. 2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose a Tagless DRAM Cache (TDC), that completely removes tag array from the DRAM cache and instead, uses the tag-array of the SRAM last level cache (LLC) along with DRAM cache way indices to locate data in the DRAM cache. Experimental evaluation, considering 4-core configuration, shows that TDC achieves a speedup of 9.97% when compared to baseline.

In our previous work with a neuronavigation-guided FUS system, only part of the cavitation signal could be monitored in real time due to the computational burden although full-burst analysis is required to detect transient and stochastic cavitation activity. In addition, the spatial resolution of PAM can be limited for a small-aperture receiving array transducer. For full-burst real-time PAM with enhanced resolution, we developed a parallel processing scheme for coherence-factor-based PAM (CF-PAM) and implemented it onto the neuronavigation-guided FUS system using a co-axial phased-array imaging transducer. Methods: Simulation and in-vitro human skull studies were conducted for the performance evaluation of the proposed method in terms of spatial resolution and processing speed. We also carried out real-time cavitation mapping during BBB opening in non-human primates (NHPs). Results: CF-PAM with the proposed processing scheme provided better resolution than that of traditional time-exposure-acoustics PAM with a higher processing speed than that of eigenspace-based robust Capon beamformer, which facilitated the full-burst PAM with the integration time of 10 ms at a rate of 2 Hz. In vivo feasibility of PAM with the co-axial imaging transducer was also demonstrated in two NHPs, showing the advantages of using real-time B-mode and full-burst PAM for accurate targeting and safe treatment monitoring. Significance: This full-burst PAM with enhanced resolution will facilitate the clinical translation of online cavitation monitoring for safe and efficient BBB opening.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2023.3266952","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01AG038961,R01EB009041,R01EB029338); Focused Ultrasound Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10122125","Cavitation mapping;focused ultrasound therapy;parallel processing;passive acoustic mapping","Transducers;Monitoring;Imaging;Graphics processing units;Real-time systems;Spatial resolution;Instruction sets","Animals;Blood-Brain Barrier;Neuronavigation;Acoustics;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonic Therapy;Microbubbles","32","","68","IEEE","9 May 2023","Oct. 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the bitstream we use is fixed, and contrary to HLS, we can alter the functionalities offered by the FPGA on-the-fly to adapt them to current usage.

Current electrophysiology paradigms are limited in that subpopulations of neurons within the network cannot be selectively addressed without the use of difficult and low yield techniques such as optogenetically tagged recordings, not suitable for use in the clinic. With the synaptrode, we aim to address these limitations by adding versatility to the current electrophysiology hardware, without the need for auxiliary tools or modifications to the subject. This versatility consists of a manufacturing technology where electrodes make synapse-like connections with selected subpopulations of neurons enabled by the molecular code of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Using the molecular specificity of CAMs we can selectively induce presynaptic or postsynaptic connections to neurons, allowing separate monitoring and stimulation channels for efferent and afferent neuron-to-neural prostheses connections. The challenge we face is to create electrodes that are small enough to interface with single neurites and yet do not exhibit impedance values prohibitively large to reliably perform electrophysiology experiments. Combining the differential coding properties of CAMs immobilized at the electrodes with the ease and the speed of electrical readout of neuronal activity, we envision a technology that would enable accelerated research in closed loop electrophysiology paradigms for health, industry, and academic applications.","1948-3554","978-1-6654-6292-1","10.1109/NER52421.2023.10123894","University of Cambridge (UK); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123894","","Electrodes;Industries;Neurites;Neural engineering;Cams;Recording;Manufacturing","","","","9","IEEE","19 May 2023","24-27 April 2023","24-27 April 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Parametric sonar has been one of the most effective equipment in seabed configuration detection and property identification. Emphases of this paper are on source signal correction of wide band parametric subbottom profiler, so we can get desired difference frequency detective signals after non-linear self-demodulation of the wide-band parametric arrays. In order to generate desired Chirp subbottom profiling signal, we have to divide the Chirp waveform which is the envelope of wide-band parametric array's primary wave by its instantaneous frequency. The correction method which is called fragment correction is analyzed subsequently, it is used to correct 1/8 Sine-Square weighted Chirp envelope signal which is a high resolution source signal of subbottom profiler. The expressions of Chirp difference signals after self-demodulation of the wide-band parametric array are derived, and the simplified forms are also proposed at the same time. We can see that the Chirp difference frequency signals with its frequency and bandwidth twice of the primary frequency wave's envelope will be generated by self-demodulation process of wide-band parametric array no matter it was weighted or not. The comparison between expressions before and after simplification indicated that simplify process and the correction methods are all reasonable, computer simulations are given simultaneously.

Dependences between statement instances in the iteration space of a loop nest impose ordering constraints that must be preserved in order to produce valid optimized, vectorized, and parallelized loop nests. This paper evaluates a new approach for fast and accurate nonlinear array dependence testing using Chains of Recurrences (CRs). A flow-sensitive loop analysis algorithm is presented for constructing the CR forms of array index expressions. Unlike other approaches, the CR forms are directly integrated into a standard dependence test to solve nonlinear CR-based dependence equations. To study the coverage and performance of the proposed CR-based enhancements of a standard test, we chose the inexact Banerjee test. We implemented a new CR-based Banerjee test in the Polaris compiler and compared the results to the Omega test and Range test on a set of SPEC and LAPACK Benchmark programs. The experimental results suggest that a CR enhancement can dramatically increase the effectiveness of a dependence test without a significant cost increase. More surprisingly, the findings indicate that the enhanced test exceeds the capabilities of the Omega and Range tests for many nonlinear dependence relations detected in the PERFECT Club and LAPACK Benchmark programs.","","978-1-59593-264-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7847606","Dependence Testing;Loop Optimization;Chains of Recurrences","Indexes;Benchmark testing;Optimization;Algebra;Arrays;Program processors","","1","","34","","9 Feb 2017","16-20 Sept. 2006","16-20 Sept. 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The receiver was found to have a higher sensitivity than the needle hydrophone, a more wideband response than the piezoceramic, and sufficient threshold for detection of microbubble emissions. Sonication of microbubbles directly and through a fragment of human skull demonstrated the ability of the receiver to detect harmonic bubble emissions, and showed potential for use in a larger scale array. Monitoring of disruption of the blood–brain barrier in rats showed functionality in vivo and the ability to detect subharmonic, harmonic, and wideband emissions during therapy.

Interstation Rayleigh wave (phase velocity) dispersion curves were obtained at periods from 10 to 50 s from empirical Green's function (EGF) derived from (ambient noise) interferometry and from 20 to 150 s from traditional two-station (TS) analysis. Here, we use these measurements to construct phase velocity maps (from 10 to 150 s, using the average interstation dispersion from the EGF and TS methods between 20 and 50 s) and estimate from them (with the Neighbourhood Algorithm) the 3-D wave speed variations and their uncertainty. The crust structure, parametrized in three layers, can be well resolved with a horizontal resolution about of 100 km or less. Because of the possible effect of mechanically weak layers on regional deformation, of particular interest is the existence and geometry of low (shear) velocity layers (LVLs). In some regions prominent LVLs occur in the middle crust, in others they may appear in the lower crust. In some cases the lateral transition of shear wave speed coincides with major fault zones. The spatial variation in strength and depth of crustal LVLs suggests that the 3-D geometry of weak layers is complex and that unhindered crustal flow over large regions may not occur. Consideration of such complexity may be the key to a better understanding of relative block motion and patterns of seismicity.","1365-246X","","10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03696.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8143304","Interferometry;Surface waves and free oscillations;Seismic tomography;Crustal structure;Asia","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","April 2008","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We propose a scalable architecture that is suitable for implementation both on ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) and FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) platforms.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9211914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9211914","ethernet;frame preemption;IEEE 802.3 standard;time sensitive networking","Conferences;IEEE 802.3 Standard;Interference;EPON;Timing;Field programmable gate arrays;Manufacturing automation","","4","","10","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","8-11 Sept. 2020","8-11 Sept. 2020","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the significance of the problem, there is still limited support for eliminating software clones through refactoring, because the unification and merging of duplicated code is a very challenging problem, especially when software clones have gone through several modifications after their initial introduction. In this work, we propose an approach for automatically assessing whether a pair of clones can be safely refactored without changing the behavior of the program. In particular, our approach examines if the differences present between the clones can be safely parameterized without causing any side-effects. The evaluation results have shown that the clones assessed as refactorable by our approach can be indeed refactored without causing any compile errors or test failures. Additionally, the computational cost of the proposed approach is negligible (less than a second) in the vast majority of the examined cases. Finally, we perform a large-scale empirical study on over a million clone pairs detected by four different clone detection tools in nine open-source projects to investigate how refactorability is affected by different clone properties and tool configuration options. Among the highlights of our conclusions, we found that (a) clones in production code tend to be more refactorable than clones in test code, (b) clones with a close relative location (i.e., same method, type, or file) tend to be more refactorable than clones in distant locations (i.e., same hierarchy, or unrelated types), (c) Type-1 clones tend to be more refactorable than the other clone types, and (d) clones with a small size tend to be more refactorable than clones with a larger size.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2015.2448531","European Union (European Social Fund—ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Program; National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF); Thalis—Athens University of Economics; Business—Software Engineering Research Platform; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7130676","Code duplication;Software clone management;Clone refactoring;Refactorability assessment;Empirical study;Code duplication;software clone management;clone refactoring;refactorability assessment;empirical study","Cloning;Arrays;Java;Software systems;Production;Space exploration","","77","","63","IEEE","22 Jun 2015","1 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing works adopt a slotted transmission strategy to reduce system complexity; they operate under the framework of coupled compressed sensing (CCS) which concatenates an outer tree code to an inner compressed sensing code for slot-wise message stitching. We suggest that by exploiting the MIMO channel information in the angular domain, redundancies required by the tree encoder/decoder in CCS can be removed to improve spectral efficiency, thereby an uncoupled transmission protocol is devised. To perform activity detection and channel estimation, we propose an expectation-maximization-aided generalized approximate message passing algorithm with a Markov random field support structure, which captures the inherent clustered sparsity structure of the angular domain channel. Then, message reconstruction in the form of a clustering decoder is performed by recognizing slot-distributed channels of each active user based on similarity. We put forward the slot-balanced  $ K $ -means algorithm as the kernel of the clustering decoder, resolving constraints and collisions specific to the application scene. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed scheme achieves a better error performance at high spectral efficiency compared to the CCS-based URA schemes.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2022.3153957","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1801102); National Science Foundation (NSFC)(grant numbers:62122052,62071289); ZTE Industry-Academia-Research Cooperation Funds; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/T015985/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721077","Activity detection;channel estimation;compressed sensing;massive machine-type communications;random access","Decoding;Encoding;Clustering algorithms;Channel estimation;Compressed sensing;Antenna arrays;Redundancy","","31","","46","IEEE","24 Feb 2022","April 2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the unification and refactoring of software clones is a challenging problem, since clones usually go through several modifications after their initial introduction. In this paper we present an approach for the unification and refactoring of software clones that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches.

Microarrays contain Nmer DNA fragments, or oligos, in a series of “wells” placed across the chip, where each well contains thousands of the same fragments and acts as a probe that detects the amount of a specific fragment. A recent use for microarrays is for identification of genomes, such as pathogens. In current techniques, probes that detect unique gene regions of particular species are selected to be placed on the microarray, using the assumption that if one gene unique to a pathogen species can be detected, then the pathogen can be classified. This approach is useful, but the technology relies on finding the gene sequences that are divergent enough to be used as a genomic identifier and robust to cross-hybridization. In our work, we present a method to choose the most unique probes between two organisms. We accomplish this by choosing the oligo probes that maximize the level of divergence between the genomes, calculated by three different information-theoretic measures. We show the results for a 12-mer and 25-mer oligo pathogen probe set and that our method chooses probes less likely to cross-hybridize.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-1814-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4650031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4650031","DNA;Information Theory;Microorganisms","Probes;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Pathogens;Mutual information;Hamming distances;Entropy;Current measurement;Sequential analysis;Databases","Algorithms;Computational Biology;Computational Biology;DNA;DNA, Complementary;Expressed Sequence Tags;Genes, Bacterial;Genetic Variation;Genome;Genome, Bacterial;Genomics;Models, Statistical;Models, Theoretical;Nucleic Acid Hybridization;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Oligonucleotides","2","","10","IEEE","14 Oct 2008","20-25 Aug. 2008","20-25 Aug. 2008","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All these features make this allocator particularly useful for computer vision applications. The main goal has been to replace the general purpose allocator on some critical places in order to remove fragmentation and improve performance. The use of Regions also reduces programmer burden. The main disadvantage of this method is that it leads to a higher memory consumption peaks than general-purpose allocators. System developers need to establish an upper bound for the maximum memory that can be allocated at once. In this paper, the performance of our approach has been compared against an architecture-optimized general purpose memory allocator in a real-time vision application.","1946-0759","978-1-4244-6850-8","10.1109/ETFA.2010.5640956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640956","","Arrays;Resource management;Machine vision;Memory management;Program processors;Clocks;Heuristic algorithms","","2","1","12","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","13-16 Sept. 2010","13-16 Sept. 2010","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies have focused on a variety of techniques to analyze RNA-protein (RBP) complex formation including NMR, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry. To explore the factors that regulate RBP formation, we developed a computational method as a step prior to biochemical validation of RBP by mass spectrometry. Here we describe a methodology to predict the sequences involved in RNA-protein complex formation including transient interactions. The approach is based on an information entropy-based algorithm calibrated against known $\Delta \mathrm {G}$ and binding probabilities for RNA nucleotides-amino acid residues. The method is then used to predict binding sites of specific RNA associated proteins identified by mass spectroscopy of RNA associated proteins. The estimates of specific nucleotide peptide interactions was based on the Gibbs free energy of nucleotide-peptide fragments in a given RBP complex, and a dynamic model that uses multiple binding sites within a nucleotide-peptide fragment to quantify the binding affinity of weak and transient RNA-protein interactions. A concept originally described by Claude Shannon is now being used to foster a new paradigm for assisting in the search for specific RNA-protein binding sites. In this paper we will detail the following information, in order: 1. An information-theoretic based approach to modelling RNA-protein interactions down to specific RNA-protein complex motifs based upon information entropy; 2. The theory applied to a calibration dataset of known RNA-protein interactions to predict the RNA-protein binding motifs; 3. A prediction of RNA-protein binding motifs on a set of co-immunoprecipitation assays.","","978-1-7281-1151-3","10.1109/CISS.2019.8692826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692826","RNA-protein binding;information entropy;thermodynamic entropy;signal processing","Amino acids;RNA;Proteins;Computational modeling;Entropy;Data models;Information entropy","","","","22","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","20-22 March 2019","20-22 March 2019","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automatic tools that can optimize for memory space utilization and performance are expected to be increasingly important in the future as increasingly larger portions of embedded designs are being implemented in software. In this paper, we describe a novel optimization framework that can be used in two different ways: (i) deciding a suitable on-chip memory capacity for a given code, and (ii) restructuring the application code to make better use of the available on-chip memory space.

Of particular interest was that they had achieved this level of performance using a high-level parallel programming model. There has been considerable concern in the U.S. about the appropriateness of its hardware and software investments in super computing technology. To help assess the U.S. strategy of building systems from commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, we explored using a combination of HPF and scalar compiler technology to tailor IMPACT-3D to microprocessor-based supercomputers and evaluated its performance and scalability on the AlphaServer-based Lemieux cluster at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center (PSC).

The orthogonal array plays an important role to create a group of tentative plans more efficiently than heuristics that is commonly used in standard onboard planning applications. The key idea to implement the proposing mission replanning software is the expression of an operational plan by a “script”. Most spacecraft mission plans are defined as a sequence of system-built-in commands, whereas this “script” contains not only the usual plans but also “logic” type commands. The logic type command is expressed in a form of a program fragment such as “IF A THEN DO B”. To make a further discussion on the proposing idea, this paper also shows a result of an experiment using an autonomous underwater vehicle.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the runtime support, two adaptive irregular applications have been parallelized using CHAOS primitives: a molecular dynamics code (CHARMM) and a code for simulating gas flows (DSMC). We have also proposed minor extensions to Fortran D which would enable compilers to parallelize irregular for all loops in such adaptive applications by embedding calls to primitives provided by a runtime library.

The secret sharing schemes have selectively been applied to many distributed storage systems connected by both wired and wireless communication links for securely storing files. However, when gathering file fragments necessary to recover a file from network-based distributed storages with diverse communication capacities, a link with the slowest communication capability can be a significant bottleneck in overall performance. Furthermore, in applying the existing schemes directly to the distributed storage systems, there occurs a critical limitation, that of requiring substantial computational overhead to divide a file into fragments and recover a file from them. We propose a new lightweight (k, n)-file sharing scheme for the distributed storages with diverse capacities, where n is the number of file fragments, and k is the minimum number of fragments needed to recover a file. Contrary to the previous works, our scheme can adaptively schedule size of the stored file fragments, and the amount of transmission data in downloading file fragments by considering the communication status of each storage device, minimizing the effect of bottleneck links, and thus reducing the file recovery time. In addition, our scheme significantly reduces the computational complexity by adopting a pure combinatorial method which does not require the solution of computation-intensive polynomial equations. We demonstrate that our scheme can greatly decrease both computation and communication costs, compared to the previous secret sharing schemes for the distributed storages.","","978-1-4799-5890-0","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997506","","Cryptography;Protocols;Silicon;Arrays;Conferences;Communication networks","","4","","16","IEEE","29 Dec 2014","29-31 Oct. 2014","29-31 Oct. 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Power characterization involves extracting NSC equations for different sub-components as a function of input size, output size and number of terms. Prototype PLAs whose are employed to derive NSC equations for a given technology. The input description is modified for power simulation by adding NSC equations with dependent variables instanced to the controller's parameters. For a given input sequence, the modified VHDL description is simulated to estimate the total power consumption.

Researchers have employed methods from formal techniques based on abstract interpretation to test-driven dynamic analysis to tackle this problem. Even though powerful techniques for generating conjunctive invariants (invariants that employ only conjunction of terms) have been developed, disjunctive invariants have remained a sore thumb for formal techniques. In this paper, we propose a technique to transform certain category of loops, those that have a static iteration pattern, into loops that can be handled by conjunctive invariant generators. The key idea is to identify a static iteration pattern that distributes the disjunction in an invariant in a manner that can be captured by only conjunctive invariants. To broaden the scope of our algorithm, we also propose the idea of parametric verification, while attempting to verify specialized versions of the program where a subset of the input variables is instantiated with certain test-inputs. Note that parametric verification distinguishes it from program testing as testing requires all of its variables to be instantiated with test-inputs. We discuss our ideas on loops drawn from real programs to establish real-world applicability of our algorithms.","1530-1362","978-1-4799-2144-7","10.1109/APSEC.2013.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6805393","Invariant Generation;Control-flow Refinement;Formal Verification","Testing;Arrays;Computers;Electronic mail;Abstracts;Transforms;Generators","","2","","14","IEEE","28 Apr 2014","2-5 Dec. 2013","2-5 Dec. 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To our knowledge, PERG is the first pattern matching hardware targeting viruses, as well as the first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into one modest FPGA chip with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. The architecture achieves roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern-matching engine which fits only 1/250th the characters.

However, due to the effects of spectrum errors rooted in experimental conditions, an accurate and fast reconstruction of original sequences has become a challenging problem. In the last decade, a variety of analyses and designs have been tried to overcome this problem, where different strategies have different trade-offs in speed and accuracy. Motivated by the idea that the errors could be identified by analyzing the interrelation of spectrum elements, this paper presents a constructive heuristic algorithm, featuring an accurate reconstruction guided by a set of well-defined criteria and rules. Instead of directly reconstructing the original sequence, the new algorithm first builds several accurate short fragments, which are then carefully assembled into a whole sequence. The experiments on benchmark instance sets demonstrate that the proposed method can reconstruct long DNA sequences with higher accuracy than current approaches in the literature.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2010.89","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5582074","DNA sequencing;sequencing by hybridization;heuristic algorithm;bioinformatics;microarrays.","DNA;Bioinformatics;Joining processes;Accuracy;Construction industry;Heuristic algorithms;Computational biology","Algorithms;Computational Biology;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Genetic;Nucleic Acid Hybridization;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Sequence Analysis, DNA","3","","23","IEEE","23 Sep 2010","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aim is to reduce raw ECAL data to a level acceptable by the CMS data acquisition (DAQ) system. For each positive level 1 trigger, the SRP is guided by trigger primitive generation electronics to identify ECAL regions with energy deposition satisfying certain programmable criteria. It then directs the ECAL read-out electronics to apply predefined zero suppression levels to the crystal data, depending whether the crystals fall within these regions or not. The main challenges for the SRP are some 200 high speed (1.6 Gbit/s) I/O channels, asynchronous operation at up to 100 kHz level 1 trigger rate, a 5-/spl mu/s real-time latency requirement and a need to retain flexibility in choice of selection algorithms. The architecture adopted for the SRP is based on modern parallel optic pluggable modules and high density field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices with embedded processors and multigigabit transceivers. Implementation studies to validate proposed solutions are presented. The performance of envisaged selection algorithms is investigated with the CMS detector simulation software. The robustness of optical communication channels is estimated via direct measurements and calculations. The feasibility to perform data reduction operations within the allocated timing budget is verified by running a representative SRP firmware on a development board with a Xilinx Virtex2Pro FPGA device.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2005.850946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1487722","Multigigabit communication channels;parallel optic technology;real-time system;system-on-chip design;trigger and data acquisition system","Collision mitigation;Field programmable gate arrays;Data acquisition;Optical arrays;Mesons;Solenoids;Large Hadron Collider;Crystals;Delay;Computer architecture","","6","","8","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is well known in the literature that the interaction between ultrasonic beams and the insonified medium is a highly nonlinear process, which potentially exhibits distinctive frequency-dependent properties for defects and random reflectors with a degree of randomness. Instead of investigating the structure and pattern of the spectrum of an individual echo, the proposed method focuses on the distinction between the ensembles of defect signals and clutter noise. A training process is used to establish the statistical analysis, based on which a hypothesis test is then applied to received echoes to detect defects. The approach is expected to be adaptive to the material microstructure and characteristics due to the statistical training. Experiments with a 5MHz transducer on austenitic steel samples from a coal fired power station are conducted. Austenitic steel is highly scattering and attenuating, and the method demonstrates accurate and reliable defect detection. When applied to A-scan waveforms, the grain noise is significantly reduced while defect signals are enhanced, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved by about 20dB. As a result, the defect is more visible and can be readily identified in B-scan images. Initial results indicate that this method is robust and delivers good performance without additional calibration and compensation.","1051-0117","978-1-4673-4562-0","10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562509","defect detection;non-destructive evaluation;ultrasound;difficult materials","Feature extraction;Acoustics;Signal to noise ratio;Materials;Speckle;Signal processing algorithms","","10","","8","IEEE","18 Jul 2013","7-10 Oct. 2012","7-10 Oct. 2012","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The space-time system, employing either a convolutional or turbo coding scheme, combines coding (temporal diversity), with RAKE (multipath diversity) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) (spatial diversity) to realize high capacity DS/CDMA mobile communication systems. The receiver considered employs a L-branch space-path RAKE receiver, followed by a soft-input (soft-output) channel decoder. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) performance and capacity tradeoff between various system parameters under a fixed total bandwidth expansion and error correction codes' complexity constraint requirements.

When changing the source code of the related class, the visualization holds the previous object state and adapts the new behavior defined by the underlying source code. This instantly enables developers to observe functionalities objects of a certain class have and how they manipulate their state, and especially, how source code changes influence their behavior.

The message-passing version of ZEUS scales better than the shared-memory one primarily because, under shared-memory, (unless data-layout directives are utilized) the domain decomposition is effectively one-dimensional.","","0-89791-985-8","10.1145/509593.509598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592586","","Hydrodynamics","","","1","6","","13 Feb 2006","15-21 Nov. 1997","15-21 Nov. 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is achieved by training ML classifiers on the scattered signal reflected by the target food product exposed to MWs. In this article, we present an enhanced ML flow to boost foreign body detection accuracy of ML classifiers in MWS systems. Innovations include assessing the performance of a multiclass classifier, training it with MW frequency pairs as features, data augmentation, a new preprocessing scaler suitable for the feature distributions in the datasets, quantization, and pruning. The final test results, obtained using our previously designed MWS system and collected dataset of contaminated hazelnut-cocoa spread jars, show a multiclass accuracy for the floating-point model of 96.5%, which corresponds to a binary-equivalent accuracy of 97.3%. This is an improvement of +3.3% against the binary classifier of the previous work. The quantized and pruned model, instead, reached a multiclass accuracy of 94.2%, or a binary accuracy of 95.4%, thus still improving the previous work by +1.4%. Also, we achieved a latency of 26 $\mu$s on an AMD/Xilinx Kria K26 field programmable gate array (FPGA), a result which is ideal for high-throughput food production lines.

Despite substantial improvements in recent years, tools built using these techniques remain too slow for most practical uses. They require transforming arbitrary programs into either Boolean logic circuits, constraint sets on Boolean variables, or other equivalent representations, and the costs of using these tools scale directly with the size of the input circuit. Hence, techniques for more efficient circuit constructions have benefits across these tools. We show efficient circuit constructions for various simple but commonly used data structures including stacks, queues, and associative maps. While current practice requires effectively copying the entire structure for each operation, our techniques take advantage of locality and batching to provide amortized costs that scale polylogarithmically in the size of the structure. We demonstrate how many common array usage patterns can be significantly improved with the help of these circuit structures.

To improve the accuracy and completeness of road extraction, we propose a neural network-based algorithm, which takes the connectivity and direction features of roads into consideration, named RoadSeg-CD. It consists of two branches: one is the main branch for road segmentation; the other is the auxiliary branch for learning road directions. In the main branch, a connectivity array is designed to utilize local contextual information and construct a connectivity loss based on the predicted probabilities of neighboring pixels. In the auxiliary branch, we proposed a novel road direction map, which is used for learning the directions of roads. The two branches are connected by specific feature fusion process, and the output from the main branch is taken as the road extraction result. Experiments on real radar images are implemented to validate the effectiveness of our method.

This paper presents its first silicon prototype and a C compiler that uses conventional CPU compiler techniques. Compared to code generation for traditional CGRAs, which require expensive place and route steps, this method of code generation reduces compile times and compiler complexity significantly. Performance and power were measured for a set of benchmark programs written in C. On average, energy efficiency of 195.1 int32 MIPS/mW and active power of 2.41μW/MHz were achieved. Peak energy efficiency of 558.2 MIPS/mW and peak performance of 97.5 MIPS were measured. Load/store instructions and instruction transfers are identified as critical factors for energy efficiency in Pasithea. In comparison to an MCU with state-of-the-art energy efficiency, Pasithea achieves higher energy efficiency in four of the benchmarked programs.

One of the common characteristics of the previously proposed approaches to disk power reduction is that they work with a given disk access pattern. In comparison, the goal of the approach proposed in this paper is to restructure application code using an optimizing compiler so that disk idle periods are lengthened. This in turn allows the underlying disk power management scheme to be more effective since such schemes usually prefer the long idle periods over the short ones. Our approach targets at large scientific applications that operate on disk-resident arrays using nested loops and exhibit regular data access patterns. To test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we implemented it within an optimizing compiler and performed experiments with six data-intensive applications that manipulate disk-resident data. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach is very successful in practice and reduces the total disk energy consumption on average by 18.17%, as compared to an execution without any disk power management, and by 11.55%, as compared to an execution that employs disks with low-power capabilities without our code restructuring approach.","","0-7695-2499-0","10.1109/CGO.2006.2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1611546","","Energy consumption;Energy management;Power system management;Hardware;Application software;Optimizing compilers;Computer science;Power engineering and energy;Testing;Performance evaluation","","","","30","IEEE","10 Apr 2006","26-29 March 2006","26-29 March 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As such, only average fission multiplicities are available and correlations between fission neutrons and photons are missing. Whereas uncorrelated fission physics is usually sufficient for standard reactor core and radiation shielding calculations, correlated fission secondaries are required for specialized nuclear instrumentation and detector modeling. For coincidence counting detector optimization for instance, the precise simulation of fission neutrons and photons that remain correlated in time from birth to detection is essential. New developments were recently integrated into the Monte Carlo transport code TRIPOLI-4 to model fission physics more precisely, the purpose being to access event-by-event fission events from two different fission models: Fission Reaction Event Yield Algorithm (FREYA) and Fission Fragment Evaporation Leading to an Investigation of Nuclear Data (FIFRELIN). TRIPOLI-4 simulations can now be performed, either by connecting via an application programming interface to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory fission library including FREYA, or by reading the external fission event data files produced by FIFRELIN beforehand. These new capabilities enable us to easily compare results from the Monte Carlo transport calculations using the two fission models in a nuclear instrumentation application. In the first part of this paper, the broad underlying principles of the two fission models are recalled. We then present the experimental measurements of neutron angular correlations for 252Cf(sf) and 240Pu(sf). The correlations were measured for several neutron kinetic energy thresholds. In the latter part of this paper, simulation results are compared with the experimental data. Spontaneous fissions in 252Cf and 240Pu are modeled by FREYA or FIFRELIN. Emitted neutrons and photons are subsequently transported to an array of scintillators by TRIPOLI-4 in the analog mode to preserve their correlations. Angular correlations between fission neutrons obtained independently from these TRIPOLI-4 simulations, using either FREYA or FIFRELIN, are compared with the experimental results. For 240Pu(sf), the measured correlations were used to tune one of the FREYA model parameters. Similarly, different sets of parameters have been tested in FIFRELIN to try to improve the agreement with the experimental data.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2018.2825646","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(grant numbers:DE-AC52-07NA27344); U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AC52-07NA27344); CEA and Electricité de France, TRIPOLI-4 is a Registered Trademark of CEA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8335802","Elementary particles;Monte Carlo methods;neutrons;nuclear measurements;statistical analysis;statistics","Neutrons;Correlation;Detectors;Monte Carlo methods;Photonics;Data models;Kinetic energy","","3","","25","IEEE","11 Apr 2018","Sept. 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The bottom acoustic properties were determined by geoacoustic inversion using the noise of R/V Antea as a noise sound source of opportunity. The vessel moved on a straight course with constant engine speed (1627 RPM) while the generated noise field was recorded by a vector sensor array deployed from a reinforced hull inflatable boat launched from the vessel. The multi-wavelength array, designed and built at EHL, is composed of four pressure sensors with different spacing combinations and two pressure gauges. The inversion approach estimates the bottom geoacoustic properties from observation of range-dependent features of vertical impedance at multiple frequencies and optimization based on a genetic algorithm. As compared to our previous two-element array, deployed offshore Amazon, the newly designed array provides more comprehensive observables and therefore more reliable geoacoustic inversion results. For this first trial, the vertical impedance data at the spectral lines of 140 Hz, 280 Hz and 321 Hz were extracted from pairs of adjacent array elements and jointly processed. The bottom compression speed (1640 m/s) and density (1.96 g/cm3) deduced from the posterior probability density functions suggest a sandy seabed. The acoustic inversion results are in general agreement with the grain size analysis of two sediment grab samples, which indicate that more than 80% of the material is composed of well-distributed sand particles of different sizes, the remaining part being shell fragments and silt/clay mixtures.","","978-1-4673-7019-6","10.1109/RIOAcoustics.2015.7473637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7473637","","Marine vehicles;Geoacoustic inversion;Acoustics;Sediments;Acoustic measurements;Oceans","","","","14","IEEE","19 May 2016","29-31 July 2015","29-31 July 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Depending on the application, the algorithm may be implemented in software or with dedicated hardware, to speedup the processing.

Large dictionaries result in large automatons that must be stored in high-latency memories, therefore limiting the processing speed. We propose a fast algorithm tailored to FPGA implementation to detect the transfer of known digital objects from their fragments. For illustrative purpose, the algorithm is applied to the detection of more than 100 000 known JPEG files by just inspecting the IP packets captured during an FTP transfer.

In order to exploit both spatial and temporal locality simultaneously, the proposed model groups hardware functions into configuration blocks of fixed size (pages), variable size (segments), or hybrid (paged segments). Multiple blocks can be configured on a chip simultaneously. Data mining techniques are used to group related functions into blocks (pages or segments) and temporal locality is exploited through block replacement techniques.

Our aim is to mitigate internal fragmentation without impacting the area and performance of the system. The first scheme introduces a parallel design for calculating the addresses of free blocks, which results in a decrease in allocation latency while maintaining acceptable resource utilization. This scheme is particularly well-suited for managing a limited number of minimum allocable units (MAU). On the other hand, the second allocator can handle a large number of MAUs due to its innovative searching mechanism. This allocator exhibits lower resource consumption and operates with an acceptable allocation latency. Furthermore, to decrease internal fragmentation, we develop a novel update mechanism for allocating information data structures in both methods. By employing these two allocator schemes, we can improve the efficiency and resource management of dynamic memory allocation for hardware systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the first and second proposed schemes achieve a minimum allocation speed-up of  $\times 2$  and  $\times 1.8$  compared to their counterparts. At the same time, they achieve a reduction of at least 78% and %88 in resource utilization, respectively.

Ideally, a compressed cache increases effective capacity by tightly compacting compressed blocks, has low tag and metadata overheads, and allows fast lookups.

In this paper, we propose the Skewed Compressed Cache (SCC), a new hardware compressed cache that lowers overheads and increases performance. SCC tracks super blocks to reduce tag overhead, compacts blocks into a variable number of sub-blocks to reduce internal fragmentation, but retains a direct tag-data mapping to find blocks quickly and eliminate extra metadata (i.e., No backward pointers). Saccades this using novel sparse super-block tags and a skewed associative mapping that takes compressed size into account. In our experiments, SCC provides on average 8% (up to 22%) higher performance, and on average 6% (up to 20%) lower total energy, achieving the benefits of the recent Decoupled Compressed Cache [26] with a factor of 4 lower area overhead and lower design complexity.","2379-3155","978-1-4799-6998-2","10.1109/MICRO.2014.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011399","cache design;compression;performance;energy","Indexes;Arrays;Compression algorithms;Complexity theory;Computers;Educational institutions;Hardware","","54","","31","IEEE","19 Jan 2015","13-17 Dec. 2014","13-17 Dec. 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The auto-generated POET scripts support extra optimizations beyond those available in the ROSE optimizer.

Very often, these optimization goals impose different and contradictory constraints on the transformations to be applied. We propose a new hierarchical compilation approach for the generation of high performance code relying on the use of state-of-the-art compilers. This approach is not application-dependent and do not require any assembly hand-coding. It relies on the decomposition of the original loop nest into simpler kernels, typically 1D to 2D loops, much simpler to optimize. We successfully applied this approach to optimize dense matrix muliply primitives (not only for the square case but to the more general rectangular cases) and convolution. The performance of the optimized codes on Itanium 2 and Pentium 4 architectures outperforms ATLAS and in most cases, matches hand-tuned vendor libraries (e.g. MKL)","","0-7695-2764-7","10.1109/CGO.2007.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4145113","","Kernel;Tiles;Optimizing compilers;Libraries;Hardware;Costs;Phased arrays;Laboratories;Constraint optimization;Assembly","","4","","23","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","11-14 March 2007","11-14 March 2007","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The notion of affinity has been used extensively for scheduling programmer defined threads to reduce remote communication costs. The most popular approach has been to schedule the thread as close to the data as possible. Most of the existing techniques expect the programmer to annotate affinity related information used by the scheduler. In this paper, we propose a framework that qualifies and quantifies various possible affinities playing a role in memory access latency in a system comprising of threads, processor nodes and data objects. We propose a technique based on cost functions to arrive at affinity information that can be used for reducing latencies. The affinity information thus obtained can be used in a number of ways such as: (1) transform the user program automatically (i.e., oblivious to the programmer); (2) highlight the user code in the integrated development toolkit used by the programmer; and (3) provide annotations that can be understood by the scheduler in making dynamic decisions of allocating objects and assigning threads to nodes. We support our framework and algorithm with the case studies/experiments done so far.","","978-0-7695-3352-0","10.1109/HPCC.2008.126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4637748","Remote access;Affinity;PGAS model;Multi-core architecture","Arrays;Cost function;Minimization;Computer architecture;Electronics packaging;Computer languages;Indexes","","","","9","IEEE","3 Oct 2008","25-27 Sept. 2008","25-27 Sept. 2008","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Supa enables computing points-to information via value-flow refinement, in environments with small time and memory budgets. We formulate Supa by solving a graph-reachability problem on an inter-procedural value-flow graph representing a program's def-use chains, which are pre-computed efficiently but over-approximately. To answer a client query (a request for a variable's points-to set), Supa reasons about the flow of values along the pre-computed def-use chains sparsely (rather than across all program points), by performing only the work necessary for the query (rather than analyzing the whole program). In particular, strong updates are performed to filter out spurious def-use chains through value-flow refinement as long as the total budget is not exhausted. We have implemented Supa on top of LLVM (4.0.0) together with a comprehensive micro-benchmark suite after a years-long effort (consisting of around 400 test cases, including hand-written ones and the ones extracted from real programs). We have evaluated Supa by choosing uninitialized pointer detection and C++ virtual table resolution as two major clients, using 24 real-world programs including 18 open-source C programs and 6 large CPU2000/2006 C++ benchmarks. For uninitialized pointer client, Supa achieves improved precision as the analysis budget increases, with its flow-sensitive (context-insensitive) analysis reaching 97.4 percent of that achieved by whole-program Sparse Flow-Sensitive analysis (SFS) by consuming about 0.18 seconds and 65 KB of memory per query, on average (with a budget of at most 10,000 value-flow edges per query). With context-sensitivity also considered, Supa becomes more precise for some programs but also incurs more analysis times. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of Supa, we have also evaluated Supa in resolving C++ virtual tables by querying the function pointers at every virtual callsite. Compared to analysis without strong updates for heap objects, Supa's demand-driven context-sensitive strong update analysis reduces 7.35 percent spurious virtual table targets with only 0.4 secs per query, on average.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2018.2869336","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE170101081,DP170103956,DP180104069); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457263","Strong updates;value flow;pointer analysis;flow sensitivity","C++ languages;Resource management;Open source software;Sensitivity;Reachability analysis;Instruction sets;Registers","","38","","58","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","1 Aug. 2020","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The multiple objectives considered are the energy components similarity to a known inhibitor and a novel drug likeliness measure based on Lipinski's rule of five. RecA protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causative agent of tuberculosis, is taken as the target for the drug design. To gauge the goodness of the results, they are compared to the outputs of LigBuilder, NEWLEAD, and Variable genetic algorithm (VGA). The same problem has also been modeled using a well-established genetic algorithm-based multiobjective optimization technique, Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), to find the efficacy of AMOSA through comparative analysis.

However, legacy or proprietary applications compiled with short-SIMD ISA cannot benefit from the long-SIMD architecture, which supports improved parallelism and enhanced vector primitives, and thus only achieve a small fraction of potential peak performance. This paper presents a dynamic binary translation technique that enables short-SIMD binaries to exploit the benefits of the new SIMD architecture by rewriting short-SIMD loop code. We propose a general approach that translates loops consisting of short-SIMD instructions to machine-independent IR, conducts SIMD loop transformation/optimization at this IR level, and finally translates to long-SIMD instructions. Two solutions are presented to enforce SIMD load/store alignment, one for the problem caused by the binary translator's internal translation condition and one general approach using loop peeling optimization.

An important problem in many sensor network applications is to decide the amount of computation (or filtering) that needs to be done in the sensor nodes before the data are shifted to a central base station. Right amount of data filtering in the sensor nodes can lead to large savings in network-wide energy consumption. The main goal of this paper is to develop an automated strategy for data filtering in wireless sensor nodes. Assuming that one needs to reduce the overall energy consumption (as opposed to reducing just computation energy or communication energy), the proposed strategy attempts to strike a balance between computation energy consumption and communication energy consumption.

Conceivably, an integrated approach that combines these two can generate much better results than each individual approach. However, there is an inherent difficulty in optimizing both data layout and loop access pattern simultaneously under a unified setting. This difficulty occurs due to the fact that a given data structure can be accessed by different loop nests of the application, and each such loop nest can demand a different memory layout transformation for the said data structure. This results in a coupling problem, where the behaviors of two (or more) loop nests are coupled to each other as a result of data sharing between them. In this paper, we present a constraint network (CN) based formulation of the integrated loop-data optimization problem. We present two alternate solutions to the data locality problem with our CN based formulation and discuss the pros and cons of each scheme.

In this paper we present a sound and highly precise approach to generate data dependences based on deductive verification. The central technique is to infer a specific form of loop invariant tailored to express dependences. To achieve full automation, we adapt predicate abstraction in a suitable manner. To retain as much precision as possible, we generalized logic-based symbolic execution to compute abstract dependence predicates.

In particular, any compiler-based parallelization scheme for chip multiprocessors should account for the fact that interprocessor communication is cheaper than off-chip memory accesses in these architectures. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a constraint network based approach to code parallelization for chip multiprocessors. Constraint networks have proven to be a useful mechanism for modeling and solving computationally intensive tasks in artificial intelligence. They operate by expressing a problem as a set of variables, variable domains and constraints and define a search procedure that tries to satisfy the constraints (an acceptable subset of them) by assigning values to variables from their specified domains. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to use a constraint network based formulation for the problem of code parallelization for chip multiprocessors. Our experimental evaluation shows that not only a constraint network based approach is feasible for our problem but also highly desirable since it outperforms all other parallelization schemes tested in our experiments.","0738-100X","1-59593-381-6","10.1145/1146909.1147083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688883","Performance;chip multiprocessing;constraint network;compiler","Constraint optimization;Concurrent computing;Artificial intelligence;Optimizing compilers;Program processors;Employment;Context;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Computer networks","","","","18","","11 Sep 2006","24-28 July 2006","24-28 July 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional fluorescent-based microarrays acquire data after the hybridization phase. During this phase, the target analytes (e.g., DNA fragments) bind to the capturing probes on the array and, by the end of it, supposedly reach a steady state. Therefore, conventional microarrays attempt to detect and quantify the targets with a single data point taken in the steady state. On the other hand, a novel technique, the so-called real-time microarray, capable of recording the kinetics of hybridization in fluorescent-based microarrays has recently been proposed. The richness of the information obtained therein promises higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller estimation error, and broader assay detection dynamic range compared to conventional microarrays. In this paper, we study the signal processing aspects of the real-time microarray system design. In particular, we develop a probabilistic model for real-time microarrays and describe a procedure for the estimation of target amounts therein. Moreover, leveraging on system identification ideas, we propose a novel technique for the elimination of cross hybridization. These are important steps toward developing optimal detection algorithms for real-time microarrays, and to understanding their fundamental limitations.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2008.924383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550568","Cross hybridization;DNA microarrays;real-time;statistical modeling","Fluorescence;Phased arrays;Steady-state;Genomics;Bioinformatics;DNA;Probes;Kinetic theory;Signal to noise ratio;Estimation error","","12","","34","IEEE","24 Jun 2008","June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, extreme scales, high levels of concurrency and the advent of multicore and many core technologies are making the high-end parallel computing systems on which these simulations run, hard to program. While the Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) languages is attempting to address the problem, the PGAS model does not easily support the coupling of multiple application codes, which is necessary for the coupled multi-physics simulations. Furthermore, existing frameworks that support coupled simulations have been developed for fragmented programming models such as message passing, and are conceptually mismatched with the shared memory address space abstraction in the PGAS programming model. This paper explores how multi-physics coupled simulations can be supported within the PGAS programming framework. Specifically, in this paper, we present the design and implementation of the XpressSpace programming system, which enables efficient and productive development of coupled simulations across multiple independent PGAS Unified Parallel C (UPC) executables. XpressSpace provides the global-view style programming interface that is consistent with the memory model in UPC, and provides an efficient runtime system that can dynamically capture the data decomposition of global-view arrays and enable fast exchange of parallel data structures between coupled codes. In addition, XpressSpace provides the flexibility to define the coupling process in specification file that is independent of the program source codes. We evaluate the performance and scalability of Xpress Space prototype implementation using different coupling patterns extracted from real world multi-physics simulation scenarios, on the Jaguar Cray XT5 system of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.","","978-1-4577-0129-0","10.1109/CCGrid.2011.73","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5948599","coupling;programming system;PGAS;workflow","Couplings;Arrays;Data models;Electronics packaging;Programming;Instruction sets;Runtime","","4","","19","IEEE","11 Jul 2011","23-26 May 2011","23-26 May 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters","J. T. L. Ho; G. G. F. Lemieux","University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada",2008 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology,"27 Jan 2009","2008","","","73","80","PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chip with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250th the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.","","978-1-4244-3783-2","10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368","","Engines;Matched filters;Databases;Pattern matching;Intrusion detection;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Application software;Acceleration;Telecommunication traffic","","20","","22","IEEE","27 Jan 2009","8-10 Dec. 2008","8-10 Dec. 2008","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is also a challenging task in terms of time and space required when rasterizing scenes with high depth complexity. When low graphics memory requirements are of utmost importance,  $k$ -buffer can objectively be considered as the most preferred framework which advantageously ensures the correct depth order on a subset of all generated fragments. Although various alternatives have been introduced to partially or completely alleviate the noticeable quality artifacts produced by the initial $k$ -buffer algorithm in the expense of memory increase or performance downgrade, appropriate tools to automatically and dynamically compute the most suitable value of $k$  are still missing. To this end, we introduce $k^+$ -buffer, a fast framework that accurately simulates the behavior of $k$ -buffer in a single rendering pass. Two memory-bounded data structures: (i) the max-array and (ii) the max-heap are developed on the GPU to concurrently maintain the $k$ -foremost fragments per pixel by exploring pixel synchronization and fragment culling. Memory-friendly strategies are further introduced to dynamically (a) lessen the wasteful memory allocation of individual pixels with low depth complexity frequencies, (b) minimize the allocated size of  $k$ -buffer according to different application goals and hardware limitations via a straightforward depth histogram analysis and (c) manage local GPU cache with a fixed-memory depth-sorting mechanism. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation is provided demonstrating the advantages of our work over all prior $k$ -buffer variants in terms of memory usage, performance cost and image quality.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2417581","ESF; National Strategic Reference Framework(grant numbers:3712); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070744","k-buffer;A-buffer;depth peeling;pixel synchronization;depth complexity histogram;dynamic geometry;k-buffer;A-buffer;depth peeling;pixel synchronization;depth complexity histogram;dynamic geometry","Rendering (computer graphics);Graphics processing units;Geometry;Memory management;Arrays;Sorting;Complexity theory","","11","","51","IEEE","27 Mar 2015","1 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At a given locality, the size-frequency distributions of craters on the lunar surface can be represented by two functions: Small craters follow a steady-state distribution of the form F = Φcμ, where F is the cumulative number of craters with a diameter ≥c, c is the diameter of the craters, Φ and μ have the steady-state values Φ = 1010-9, and μ = —2.00 at all five Surveyor landing sites. Larger craters are represented by the function F = χcλ, where λ < μ, and χ varies from one landing site to another. The solution for c at the intersection of F = χcλ with F = Φcμ, designated as c„ is the upper limiting crater diameter for the steady-state distribution. The value of c, is a function of the age of the surface on which the regolith has formed. The thickness of the lunar regolith may be estimated from a variety of observational data. The estimated thickness of the regolith at a given Surveyor landing site is bracketed by the original depths of (1) the smallest blocky-rimmed craters that cut through the regolith and excavate coherent material beneath, and (2) the largest, sharp, raised-rim craters without blocks that have been excavated wholly within the slightly cohesive material that forms the regolith. Other direct estimates of the thickness of the regolith are the inferred original depth of the largest craters believed to have been formed by drainage of the regolith material into subregolith fissures and, at the Surveyor-7 site, the depth at which the surface sampler instrument encountered coherent material. The thickest regolith was found at the Surveyor-6 site, where it is estimated to be more than 10 meters thick, and the thinnest was found at the Surveyor-7 site, where it is estimated to be 2 to 15 cm thick. Particle counts from sample areas at each of the Surveyor landing sites show an approximately linear relationship between the log of the cumulative particle counts and the log of the particle size. A power function of the form N = KDλ (where N is the cumulative number of particles with diameter equal to or larger than D, and D is the diameter of particles) can be fitted to the data at each site. The size-frequency distribution of resolvable fragments at the Surveyor 3, 5, and 6 landing sites was found to be the same, within errors of estimation, but at the Surveyor 1 and 7 sites coarse fragments are more numerous. Considering all five sites, we found a strong inverse correlation between the abundance of coarse blocks and the thickness of the regolith. The coarsest fragments are most abundant at the sites with the thinnest regolith.","1944-799X","","10.1029/RS005i002p00129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7772459","","Moon;Steady-state;Cameras;Lenses;TV;Face;Surface treatment","","4","","","","9 Dec 2016","Feb. 1970","","AGU","AGU Journals"

However, their deployment in real-world scenarios is often constrained by fragmented model design and limited adaptability to complex gas mixtures. To address these challenges, we propose a unified modeling approach that supports both gas-component identification and gas-concentration estimation. First, we extend the gas component strategy (GCS) into a modular learning paradigm that isolates individual gas components during training, enabling scalable generalization to unseen mixtures with minimal retraining. Second, we introduce the signal graph framework (SGF), a unified model architecture that transforms sensor responses into dynamic signal graphs. SGF provides a shared architectural backbone for both classification and regression. Task-specific models are trained independently but retain structural consistency, which simplifies code maintenance, facilitates hardware deployment, and streamlines system integration. Experiments on a custom dataset containing binary and ternary gas mixtures demonstrate over 99% identification accuracy and up to 35% reductions in estimation error compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond laboratory settings, GCS and SGF mitigate class imbalance and error entanglement, while sustaining accuracy on unseen combinations.

However, many challenges arise from partial reconfiguration implementation. The placement and routing (P&R) of the hardware modules is a computationally intensive task, and the state-of-art algorithms are not suitable to place and route modules at run-time. This paper makes several contributions: (1) Single Placement at run-time: we propose a novel P&R algorithm based on greedy heuristic where a single placement is performed at run-time in few milliseconds. (2) Implicit Graph Model: the FPGA is modelled as an implicit graph with a direct correspondence to the physical FPGA, and the P&R is performed as a graph mapping problem by exploring the node locality during the depth-first traversal. (3) Polynomial Placement: we show that even a single placement can be routed without critical path degradation.

This often results in residual range cell migration (RCM) exceeding several or even dozens of range resolution cells, which notably degrades the performance of traditional autofocus algorithms and seriously affects the quality of real-time imaging. Considering this, we propose a real-time residual RCM correction scheme based on the autocorrelated normalized cross-power spectrum (ANCPS). First, the range-compressed image is segmented into blocks based on the azimuth and range. The ANCPS is then used to estimate the optimal residual RCM for each subblock. Second, the optimal segment is selected from the residual RCM curve fragments estimated by various subblocks. Finally, the residual RCM fragments are spliced and filtered to correct the complete data. When the algorithm is deployed on a GPU platform, it only takes 1.39 s to process an  $8\times 40$  K high-resolution original SAR image, and the calculation time is reduced by 94.6% compared with only using a CPU for calculation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed residual RCM correction scheme has good convergence, can achieve subpixel residual RCM compensation without iteration and interpolation, has a simple calculation process, is efficient, and has strong parallelism. It is thus suitable for deployment in GPUs and is conducive to realizing real-time SAR autofocus at a low cost and with a high resolution.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2025.3537865","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3901601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10885372","Autocorrelated normalized cross-power spectrum (ANCPS);correction of range cell migration (RCM);parallel computing;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) real-time autofocus","Image segmentation;Imaging;Graphics processing units;Radar imaging;Apertures;Real-time systems;Robustness;Trajectory;Synthetic aperture radar;Field programmable gate arrays","","","","35","IEEE","13 Feb 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The distributed sort algorithm is utilized to reduce the sorting complexity. The throughput of SA sorting is maximized through 2,048 insertion-sorting elements.

Here, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fragmentation properties of a sample of 10 IRDCs, which have been highlighted as some of the best candidates to study HMSF within the Milky Way. To do so, we have obtained a set of large mosaics covering these IRDCs with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 3 (or 3 mm). These observations have a high angular resolution (∼3 arcsec; ∼0.05 pc), and high continuum and spectral line sensitivity (∼0.15 mJy beam−1 and ∼0.2 K per 0.1 km s−1 channel at the N2H+ (1 − 0) transition). From the dust continuum emission, we identify 96 cores ranging from low to high mass (M = 3.4−50.9 M⊙) that are gravitationally bound (αvir = 0.3−1.3) and which would require magnetic field strengths of B = 0.3−1.0 mG to be in virial equilibrium. We combine these results with a homogenized catalogue of literature cores to recover the hierarchical structure within these clouds over four orders of magnitude in spatial scale (0.01–10 pc). Using supplementary observations at an even higher angular resolution, we find that the smallest fragments (<0.02 pc) within this hierarchy do not currently have the mass and/or the density required to form high-mass stars. None the less, the new ALMA observations presented in this paper have facilitated the identification of 19 (6 quiescent and 13 star-forming) cores that retain >16 M⊙ without further fragmentation. These high-mass cores contain trans-sonic non-thermal motions, are kinematically sub-virial, and require moderate magnetic field strengths for support against collapse. The identification of these potential sites of HMSF represents a key step in allowing us to test the predictions from high-mass star and cluster formation theories.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9491360","stars: formation;stars: massive;ISM: clouds","","","","","","","20 Jul 2021","Oct. 2021","","OUP","OUP Journals"

During the last decades, the model received strong interest and many researchers have devised algorithms for it. However, most of this work focuses on theoretical aspects. Due to some idealistic modeling assumptions only a few attempts have been made to implement the model and to study the practical use of reconfigurable meshes. In this paper, we leverage the reconfigurable mesh model to study potential architectures and programming models for future many-cores. We design a reconfigurable mesh in form of a scalable soft core array with a reconfigurable interconnect and implement it on FPGA technology in order to create a prototype platform. We present an overall hardware/software tool flow for generating and programming reconfigurable mesh prototypes. The new language ARMLang and a corresponding compiler facilitate the programming of the massively parallel processor arrays. To our knowledge, this work is the first practical study of word-level reconfigurable meshes. To analyze the performance of our implementation we study four algorithmic kernels from the application domains arithmetic, sorting, graph algorithms and imaging. For each kernel, we devise a reconfigurable mesh program in ARMLang, compile it to our soft core array and measure its runtime depending on the mesh size. Then, we compare the runtimes to two sequential implementations of the algorithms, which are executed on two single core systems. The results show that many-cores leveraging the reconfigurable mesh model can efficiently use a vast number of processing elements and that, for the chosen algorithms, they come close to optimally parallelized programs.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2013.174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587040","Multi-core/single-chip multiprocessors;On-chip interconnection networks;Reconfigurable hardware;Parallelism and concurrency;Reconfigurable mesh, FPGA many-core, reconfigurable architectures, massively parallel processor arrays","Wireless mesh networks;Switches;Ports (Computers);Computational modeling;Reconfigurable architectures;Multicore processing","","11","","64","IEEE","26 Aug 2013","1 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One key problem is the weights that are signed values. However, in a ReRAM crossbar, weights are stored as conductance of the crossbar cells, and the in-situ computation assumes all cells on each crossbar column are of the same sign. The current architectures either use two ReRAM crossbars for positive and negative weights (PRIME), or add an offset to weights so that all values become positive (ISAAC). Neither solution is ideal: they either double the cost of crossbars, or incur extra offset circuity. To better address this problem, we propose FORMS, a fine-grained ReRAM-based DNN accelerator with algorithm/hardware co-design. Instead of trying to represent the positive/negative weights, our key design principle is to enforce exactly what is assumed in the in-situ computation— ensuring that all weights in the same column of a crossbar have the same sign. It naturally avoids the cost of an additional crossbar. Such polarized weights can be nicely generated using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) regularized optimization during the DNN training, which can exactly enforce certain patterns in DNN weights. To achieve high accuracy, we divide the crossbar into logical sub-arrays and only enforce this property within the fine-grained sub-array columns. Crucially, the small sub-arrays provides a unique opportunity for input zero-skipping, which can significantly avoid unnecessary computations and reduce computation time. At the same time, it also makes the hardware much easier to implement and is less susceptible to non-idealities and noise than coarse-grained architectures. Putting all together, with the same optimized DNN models, FORMS achieves 1.50× and 1.93× throughput improvement in terms of $\frac{{GOPs}}{{s \times m{m^2}}}$ and $\frac{{GOPs}}{W}$ compared to ISAAC, and 1.12× ~2.4 × speed up in terms of frame per second over optimized ISAAC with almost the same power/area cost. Interestingly, FORMS optimization framework can even speed up the original ISAAC from 10.7 × up to 377.9×, reflecting the importance of software/hardware co-design optimizations.","2575-713X","978-1-6654-3333-4","10.1109/ISCA52012.2021.00029","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499856","","Training;Deep learning;Quantization (signal);Computational modeling;Resistive RAM;Computer architecture;Throughput","","59","","85","IEEE","4 Aug 2021","14-18 June 2021","14-18 June 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, we tackle the main difficulty in constructing concurrent systems, that of constructing a control that prevents conflicts due to concurrency. At the same time, we avoid the complexity of the datapath, taking advantage of the fact that it must mirror the operations in the sequential variant. We start with the controller's specification, an equivalence criterion written in a fragment of second-order logic, stating that for all possible inputs/states, there exist Boolean control values such that the outcome is correct. We show how to decide such formulas by a reduction to propositional logic. From this formula, we can then extract the controller.

In particular, array-based scientific codes can spend a significant portion of their power budget on the disk subsystem. Observing this, the prior research proposed several strategies, such as spinning down to low-power modes or adjusting the speed of the disk in lower RPM, to reduce power consumption on the disk subsystem. A common characteristic of most of these techniques is that they are reactive, in the sense that they make their decisions based on the disk access patterns observed during execution. While such techniques are certainly useful and the published studies reveal that they can be very effective in some cases, one can conceivably achieve better results by adopting a proactive scheme. Focusing on array-intensive scientific applications, this paper makes two important contributions. First, it presents a compiler-driven proactive approach to disk power management. In this approach, the compiler analyzes the application code and extracts the disk access pattern. It then uses this information to insert explicit disk power management calls in the appropriate places in the code. It also pre-activates a disk (placed into the low-power mode) before it is actually needed to eliminate the potential performance impact of disk power management. The second contribution of this paper is a code transformation approach that can be used to increase the savings coming from a disk power management scheme (whether reactive or proactive). Our experimental results with several scientific application codes show that both the proactive disk power management approach and the disk layout aware code transformations are beneficial from both power consumption and execution time perspectives.","1530-2075","0-7695-2312-9","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419818","","Energy management;Application software;Energy consumption;Power system management;Pattern analysis;Data mining;Large-scale systems;Cooling;Voltage;Operating systems","","31","","24","IEEE","18 Apr 2005","4-8 April 2005","4-8 April 2005","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This adaptive coprocessor is compared to a VLIW machine in term of both die area occupied and performance. The parametric bounds necessary to justify the adoption of an FPGA-based coprocessor are established. An abstract field programmable gate array model is used to investigate the area and delay characteristics of arithmetic circuits implemented on FPGA architectures to determine the potential speedup of FPGA-based coprocessors. Analysis shows that integrated FPGA arrays are suitable as coprocessor platforms for realising algorithms that require only limited numbers of multiplication instructions. Inherent FPGA characteristics limit the data-path widths that can be supported efficiently for these applications. An FPGA-based adaptive coprocessor requires a large minimum die area before any advantage over a VLIW machine of a comparable size can be realised.","","0-8186-7548-9","10.1109/FPGA.1996.564843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=564843","","Coprocessors","","23","57","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","17-19 April 1996","17-19 April 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motivated by this observation, several recent ef- forts focused on reducing disk power consumption through hardware, OS and compiler based techniques. This paper presents a novel approach to reducing disk power consump- tion of large-scale, array-intensive scientific applications. It proposes and evaluates a compiler-based approach that employs two complementary techniques: data reorganiza- tion and disk mapping. The first of these, data reorga- nization, determines a suitable layout for data in the ar- ray space, whereas the second technique, disk mapping, decides the corresponding layout in the disk space. The goal of data reorganization and disk mapping is to ensure that data (from the different disk-resident arrays) that are accessed within the same loop iteration are colocated in the same set of disks. In this way, we can increase disk inter-access times (idle periods of disks) and this in turn al- lows better exploitation of the underlying hardware mech- anisms used for reducing power. Our experiments with eight disk I/O-intensive scientific applications indicate that the proposed approach brings significant reductions in en- ergy consumption, whether the underlying disk system uses spin-down disks or speed-reduced disks, two previously- proposed hardware-based disk power reduction schemes. The results also show that both the components of our scheme (data reorganization and disk mapping) are very important since applying any of these components alone does not generate large savings for most of our applica- tions.","","0-7695-2833-3","10.1109/CCGRID.2007.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215423","","Energy consumption;Power system reliability;Hardware;Cooling;Large-scale systems;Embedded system;Optimizing compilers;Computer science;Data engineering;Reliability engineering","","3","","20","IEEE","29 May 2007","14-17 May 2007","14-17 May 2007","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary disadvantage of using shadow-maps is their excessive size for large scenes in case high quality shadows are needed. To eliminate large memory requirements and texture-size limitations of the current generation GPUs, texture compression is an important tool. We present a framework where compressed ID-shadow-maps are used for real-time rendering of static scene shadows. The texture compression is performed off-line on the CPU and real-time decompression is performed on the GPU within a fragment-shader for shadowing the pixels. The use of ID shadow-maps (instead of conventional depth-based shadow-maps) is the key to high compression ratios. The ID shadow-map is compressed on the CPU by first partitioning it into blocks. Each compressed block is packed densely into a global array, while a pointer table is constructed that holds a pointer to the start of every compressed block in the global array. This data organization provides the GPU with a random access to the start of each compressed block thus enables fast parallel decompression. The proposed decompression shader-program and the underlying data structures can be applied to any type of array consisting of integers. The framework is implemented using OpenGL and GLSL.","2379-5352","978-1-4244-7601-5","10.1109/ISPDC.2010.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532495","ID Shadow-Maps;Textures;Run Length Encoding;GLSL;Shaders","Rendering (computer graphics);Distributed computing;Real time systems;Concurrent computing;Robustness;Shadow mapping;Data structures;Graphics processing unit;Image coding","","1","1","11","IEEE","29 Jul 2010","7-9 July 2010","7-9 July 2010","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Code clone detection plays an important role in software maintenance, code refactoring, and reuse. A substantial amount of research has been conducted in the past to detect clones. A majority of these approaches use lexical and syntactic information to detect clones. However, only a few of them target semantic clones. Recently, motivated by the success of deep learning models in other fields, including natural language processing and computer vision, researchers have attempted to adopt deep learning techniques to detect code clones. These approaches use lexical information (tokens) and(or) syntactic structures like abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to detect code clones. However, they do not make sufficient use of the available structural and semantic information, hence limiting their capabilities. This paper addresses the problem of semantic code clone detection using program dependency graphs and geometric neural networks, leveraging the structured syntactic and semantic information. We have developed a prototype tool Holmes, based on our novel approach and empirically evaluated it on popular code clone benchmarks. Our results show that Holmes performs considerably better than the other state-of-the-art tool, TBCCD. We also assessed Holmes on unseen projects and performed cross dataset experiments to evaluate the generalizability of Holmes. Our results affirm that Holmes outperforms TBCCD since most of the pairs that Holmes detected were either undetected or suboptimally reported by TBCCD.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3105556","Department of Science and Technology; Confederation of Indian Industry; Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi; Nucleus Software Exports Ltd; National Research Foundation; Industry Alignment Fund – Pre-positioning; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9516896","Program representation learning;semantic code clones;graph-based neural networks;siamese neural networks;program dependency graphs","Cloning;Semantics;Syntactics;Deep learning;Arrays;Tools;Neural networks","","33","","93","IEEE","18 Aug 2021","1 Oct. 2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To mitigate this problem, we present an automated approach to helping developers find and analyze contextual differences of clones. Our approach represents context of clones as program dependence graphs, and applies a graph differencing technique to identify required contextual differences of clones. We implemented a tool called CloneDifferentiator that identifies contextual differences of clones and allows developers to formulate queries to distill candidate clones that are useful for a given refactoring task.

Accordingly, a shared lower-level cache reduces conflict misses by adopting a multi-way set-associative structure with high associativity. This structure allows fast access because it allows access to all the ways in the cache set in parallel. However, it consumes a large amount of dynamic energy. Therefore, various schemes have been proposed to increase the energy efficiency of the cache memory. These schemes use way prediction or partial comparison to reduce unnecessary way access. This paper proposes a way prediction algorithm suitable for a shared second-level cache with high associativity. This algorithm is based on real-time way access dominance detection (WADD). Through this detection, the proposed algorithm can determine the number and location of way candidates suitable for each partial access pattern among the fragmented access patterns owing to the first-level cache replacement policy and intermingled accesses by multiple cores. Through this process, the proposed algorithm can implement an efficient way prediction. Simulation results show that the WADD exhibits the highest energy efficiency among the comparison groups, thus reducing the energy-delay product by 13.5% compared with the conventional cache without way prediction. This result is achieved by reducing the way prediction penalty through fast detection and high prediction accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126739","Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Hwaseong, South Korea; Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)](grant numbers:2021-0-00754); Software Systems for AI Semiconductor Design; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606910","Cache memory;computer architecture;energy efficiency;multiprocessing systems;way prediction","Prediction algorithms;Cache memory;Rail to rail inputs;Arrays;Memory management;Heuristic algorithms;Power demand","","1","","29","CCBY","8 Nov 2021","2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper studies a testing method of the projectiles explosive position using a combination of six screen sensors and an area array camera. We set up a calculation model of the projectile proximity explosion position parameters, which establishes the proximity explosion area probability of the projectile hitting the target. The calculation method of the target damage condition probability under the condition of firing multiple projectiles in one test was researched according to the dispersion characteristics of projectile proximity explosion, the damage area of the target, and the intersection condition of the projectile and the target.

In this study, we examine how to predict software vulnerabilities from source code by employing ML prior to their release. To this end, we develop a source code representation method that enables us to perform intelligent analysis on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) form of source code and then investigate whether ML can distinguish vulnerable and nonvulnerable code fragments. To make a comprehensive performance evaluation, we use a public dataset that contains a large amount of function-level real source code parts mined from open-source projects and carefully labeled according to the type of vulnerability if they have any.We show the effectiveness of our proposed method for vulnerability prediction from source code by carrying out exhaustive and realistic experiments under different regimes in comparison with state-of-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3016774","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey through the 1515 Frontier Research and Development Laboratories Support Program(grant numbers:5169902); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9167194","AST;machine learning;source code;vulnerability prediction","Software;Security;Natural language processing;Syntactics;Predictive models;Software metrics;Machine learning","","82","","38","CCBY","14 Aug 2020","2020","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Manned Spacecraft Propulsion through Direct Conversion of Nuclear Energy","J. Slough","MSNW LLC, Bellevue, WA",2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO),"10 Aug 2022","2022","","","1","13","Fission-based power sources have been used in space as early as the Voyager missions. However, the use of nuclear power for manned space exploration has yet to be accomplished. Reactor-based (thermal or electric) propulsion efforts have been stymied by enormous launch costs and extremely long mission times, which endanger the health of the astronauts, and increase the risk of failure due to the need for complex space rendezvous and assembly. All of this is avoided with a compact, high efficiency, single-launch spacecraft such as that projected for the Fission-Powered Pulsed Plasma Propulsion concept (F4P) proposed here. In the F4P scheme, the immense energy of the nuclear reaction is to be harnessed in a more direct and powerful way to propel the spacecraft with the optimal range of jet power (30–100 MW), and at the most efficacious exhaust velocity (30–50 km/sec). It is accomplished in the following manner: (1) Large, thin hoops of Lithium (Li) metal are driven at the proper angle and speed for convergence onto fissile target injected from the F4P thruster throat. (2) The converging Li shells form a thick blanket compressing the fissile material thereby producing a large increase in reactivity and fission energy release. (3) Virtually all of the energy released (plasma thermal, radiant, shell-ohmic, and fission-fragment) is absorbed by the Lithium shell which is subsequently vaporized and ionized. This Li plasma plume expands out against the thruster's divergent magnetic field which acts as a barrier and directs the plasma flow out of the thruster resulting in minimal interaction with the spacecraft. In this manner, both high exhaust velocity and thrust are achieved with only minor interaction with the spacecraft. To understand the issues involved with this approach, as well as design an experimental test, a 1D analytical model was developed and 3D ANSYS Explicit Dynamics® of the liner implosion were carried out. The inductive coupling and drive efficiency of the compression for a single liner was evaluated with the one-dimensional model which included the key circuit, magnetic field and liner parameters. The model was then used to characterize the liner motion as a function of liner mass, resistivity, stored energy, coil voltage and initial magnetic field. The stability and structural behavior of multiple liners was studied with the 3D ANSYS code. Techniques for controlling liner bucking as well as liner rotation for Rayleigh-Taylor stability were examined with these codes Experimental testing at the relevant scale have validated the metal hoop compression process. The major unknown to be resolved is the functional dependence of the fission energy yield on the several key parameters of the compression process. This must be fully understood and tested to prove the viability of the F4P concept. The current effort is focused on (1) a detailed physics model of the heating and compression of the fissile fuel from a solid to an ionized gas. (2) Calculations to determine the fission amplification and energy yield throughout the compression cycle as a function of fissile mass and density.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-3760-8","10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843421","","Space vehicles;Three-dimensional displays;Attitude control;Space missions;Propulsion;Lithium;Stability analysis","","2","","15","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","5-12 March 2022","5-12 March 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Monitoring litter accumulation is currently labour-intensive and costly, often resulting in action being taken only once the environment has already become polluted. We contribute LIZARD, a novel pervasive sensing solution for detecting and monitoring plastics that is tailored to autonomous vehicles. LIZARD relies on an innovative sensing pipeline that combines thermal imaging and optical sensing. The intuition is to rely on thermal dissipation patterns to identify larger (macro) plastics and use optical sensing to sample area with the highest density of plastics to identify smaller (micro and meso) plastics. Ours is the first pervasive sensing solution that can detect microplastics in the environment and be integrated into autonomous vehicles. Indeed, state-of-the-art solutions are either limited to laboratory analysis with special instruments or rely on manual observation without being able to identify the smallest plastics – which often are the most dangerous. We evaluate LIZARD through rigorous experiments that combine controlled laboratory settings and in-the-field measurements carried out in three real-world locations to evaluate LIZARD. Our results show that LIZARD can be used to detect plastics of different sizes with an accuracy of up to 80%. The performance depends on the diameter of the plastics, the background surface, and the luminosity of the environment. We also demonstrate that our solution can be easily integrated with ground drones, enabling (semi-)autonomous litter monitoring. Our work offers an innovative way to harness pervasive sensing to address an important global (environmental) sustainability challenge while paving the way toward improved monitoring of the accumulation of harmful plastic fragments in the environment.","","979-8-3503-7025-6","10.1109/IoTDI61053.2024.00008","European Social Fund; Academy of Finland; Nokia; European Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10562171","Drones;IoT;Visual inspection;Light reflectivity","Reflectivity;Instruments;Pipelines;Imaging;Manuals;Pollution measurement;Plastics","","2","","53","IEEE","24 Jun 2024","13-16 May 2024","13-16 May 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To aid in PR system design, we present two portable, high-level cost models, which are based on the synthesis report results generated by Xilinx tools. These cost models estimate PRR size/organization given the PRR's associated PRMs to maximize the PRRs' resource utilizations and estimate the PRM's associated partial bitstream sizes based on the PRR sizes/organizations.

However, existing schemes are designed for static task sets without adjustable shapes, incapable of optimizing the placement problem in datacenters. In this paper, FEditor is proposed as the first consecutive task placement scheme with adjustable shapes. It expands the planar FPGA models into three-dimensional ones with timestamps to accommodate consecutive tasks. To reduce the complexity of three-dimensional resource management, State Frames (SFs) are designed to compress the models losslessly. Three metrics and a nested heuristic algorithm are used for task placement. Experimental results demonstrate that FEditor has improved resource utilization by at least 19.8% and acceptance rate by at least 10% compared to the referenced algorithms.

At the final stage, a colorization model was also implemented to bring back the reconstructed frames with maintaining the quality of the frames. The performance of the proposed technique is measured by analyzing the energy consumption and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and through the statistical analysis of the data. The supremacy of the proposed technique over other competing schemes is judged through the simulation results in terms of acceptable reconstruction quality while consuming a lower amount of power.","","978-1-6654-9790-9","10.1109/MysuruCon55714.2022.9971802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9971802","WSN;DCT;Video compression;Transform techniques;PFCT;Colorization","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;PSNR;Statistical analysis;Simulation;Transforms","","1","","29","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","16-17 Oct. 2022","16-17 Oct. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They have found important applications in biomedicine, such as drug screening and personalized therapy. However, conventional organoid culture methods lack control of physical properties like size and distribution, leading to increased heterogeneity and very low batch-to-batch reproducibility, which significantly limits their widespread use. Controlling these properties at the microscale is challenging, particularly for fragile fragments, which are the main source for culturing organoids. To address this issue, we present a robotic micromanipulation system that allows operators to select fragments of particular sizes and automatically transfer them into a customized in-situ organoid chip (IOC) for culture. The chip was designed with microwell arrays to uniform the culture environment and facilitate imaging analysis. The transfer of fragments is modeled based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and is enabled by designing a robust model predictive control (RMPC) framework. Simulation and experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of the model and controller. In colorectal cancer organoid culture experiments, our system significantly improved the morphological homogeneity of organoids. Note to Practitioners—Organoids have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising in vitro models. Lacking control of its size and distribution results in significant heterogeneity and low batch-to-batch reproducibility, which limits its wide uses. Here, we report a robotic micromanipulation system that allows operators to select fragments of particular sizes and morphologies and automatically transfer them into a customized organoid chip for culture.

DELILA employs a distributed, modular architecture with five components: data sources, merger, data sinks, user interface (UI), and application programming interface (API). The system supports triggerless list-mode acquisition from silicon strips, scintillators, and germanium detectors using CAEN digitizers with various firmware (FW) (digital pulse processing—pulse shape discrimination (DPP-PSD), DPP-pulse height discrimination (PHA), charge integration [DPP-charge integration (QDC)], and waveform recording).

Performance evaluation demonstrates sustained acquisition at 100 kHz/channel with FELib libraries and 2 MHz for single-channel 2730 digitizers. The system achieves 60 MB/s data rates with compact 30-B events, enabling efficient storage. DELILA scales from 3 to 320 channels with real-time monitoring and event rate displays updated every 1–10 s. The angular-based web interface with RESTful API facilitates remote operation and automated monitoring integration.

Since future technologies offer the promise of being able to integrate billions of transistors on a chip, the prospects of having hundreds to thousands of processors on a single chip along with an underlying memory hierarchy and an interconnection system is entirely feasible. This paper proposes a compiler directed integrated code and data placement scheme for two-dimensional mesh based CMP architectures. The proposed approach uses a Code-Data Affinity Graph (CDAG) to represent the relationship between loop iterations and array data and then assigns the sets of loop iterations to processing cores and sets of data blocks to on-chip memories. During the mapping process, the on-chip memory capacity and load imbalance across different cores and the topology of the NoC are taken into account. In this paper, we present two variants of our approach: depth-first placement (DFP) and breadth-first placement (BFP), and compare them to three alternate code/data mapping schemes. The experimental evaluation shows that our CDAG based placement schemes are very successful in practice, achieving average performance improvements of 19.9% (DFP) and 16.8% (BFP), and average energy improvements of 29.7% (DFP) and 27.8% (BFP).","1558-2434","978-1-4244-2819-9","10.1109/ICCAD.2008.4681635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681635","","Transistors;Educational institutions;Embedded system;Topology;Network-on-a-chip;Network interfaces;Program processors;Programming profession;Memory management;Costs","","1","","21","IEEE","18 Nov 2008","10-13 Nov. 2008","10-13 Nov. 2008","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The structures were fabricated in two different vacuum deposition processes (first the H2Pc film and than the Pd) onto an LiNbO3 Y- cut Z-propagating substrate for the surface acoustic wave (SAW) method and additionally (in these same technological processes) onto a glass substrate with a planar microelectrode array for the simultaneous monitoring of the structure planar resistance. A very good correlation has been observed between these two methods (frequency changes for the SAW method coincide with the decrease of the bilayer structure resistance), especially for higher hydrogen concentrations. Although simultaneous measurements were not always feasible (too great resistance in the samples for the structure with the thinnest H2Pc), they can provide information about the acoustoelectric interactions between SAW and charge carriers in the bilayer structure. The interaction speed method is based on the great variance in interaction speeds at various hydrogen concentrations (from 2.5% to 4% in synthetic dry air), even though the amplitude signal reaches almost the same frequency level. For a particular chosen initial interaction time interval, a distinct interaction speed can be distinguished with great resolution (from 7.5 Hz/s for 2.5% H2 in air to 29.1 Hz/s for 4% for the structure with 160-nm H2Pc and 20-nm Pd).

Thus, NVS provides an opportunity to exploit temporal and spatial redundancy in video streams by enabling the following deep neural network (DNN) processor for object recognition to process only foreground object regions in valid frames. However, the NVS data inevitably contains noise leading to false frame generation. Moreover, objects may be fragmented due to a lack of events leading to wrong object region proposals (RPs). Hence, it is important to have an always ON image processor to perform image restoration (IR) and RP operations for NVS data. In this article, we propose a hybrid memory bitcell with collocated static random access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) consisting of 11 transistors [11T-collocated SRAM and DRAM (CRAM)] to perform in-memory computing (IMC)-based IR and RP for event-based binary image (EBBI) frame from a stationary NVS. We propose IMC-based charge diffusion for IR (denoise and region filling) by enabling a 2-D interconnection of bitcells across the whole array for globally parallel computing. The proposed CRAM supports projection mode for IMC-based RP, which enables 1-D projection of objects on the horizontal and vertical axes and finds regions through a recently proposed iterative algorithm. We also proposed an RP update (RPU) algorithm and hardware to improve RP accuracy by 1.6 $\times $  over the prior art. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS, the 320  $\times $  240 quarter video graphics array (QVGA) macro achieves a maximal energy efficiency (throughput) of 1220 TOPS/W (1301 GOPS) without RPU and 915 TOPS/W (976 GOPS) with RPU, both of which are superior to the prior art. We also show that the accuracy of IR and RP obtained by the proposed architecture is better than earlier methods.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2022.3218573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9947277","Binary image;charge diffusion;energy efficient;image restoration (IR);in-memory computing (IMC);neuromorphic vision sensors (NVSs);region proposal (RP)","Random access memory;Clocks;Arrays;Vision sensors;Transistors;Throughput;In-memory computing","","11","","33","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","March 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The FMTP model employs discrete representations to enhance computational efficiency by reducing information redundancy while maintaining the flexibility to utilize past experiences. Specifically, a learnable memory array is designed by consolidating continuous trajectory representations from the training set using vector quantization operations during the training phase. The array further eliminates redundant information while preserving essential features in discrete form. Additionally, an advanced reasoning engine based on language models is developed to deeply learn the associative rules among these discrete representations.

The proposed LoRa communication system comprises a LoRa sensor node board and an IoT-LoRa gateway board. The LoRa sensor node board is used to capture microplastic images using a digital camera and collect analog signal data from an  $8\times 8$  photodiode array which detects the reflected light from microplastic fragments. The data are transmitted using a LoRa elliptical patch antenna in the sensor node board, operating at 0.915 GHz for long-range data transfer. The IoT-LoRa gateway board is used to forward data received from the LoRa sensor node board to a cloud server via the internet, and the stored data are accessible and viewable via a smartphone. In this research, the antenna design is optimized by using machine learning (ML) algorithms, unlike conventional antenna design methods which rely on the manual and iterative process. The ML-optimized dual-band LoRa elliptical patch antenna covers the LoRa, UHF RFID, and ZigBee frequency bands, with an omnidirectional radiation pattern. The measured impedance bandwidths (IBWs) are 8.93% (0.868–0.949 GHz) and 12.69% (2.36–2.68 GHz) for the lower and upper frequency bands, respectively, with the corresponding impedance matching ( $\vert S_{\mathbf {11}} \vert $ ) of –23.02 dB at 0.907 GHz and −27.27 dB at 2.52 GHz. Two ML-optimized LoRa elliptical patch antennas are subsequently integrated into the LoRa communication system, that is, one on the LoRa sensor node board and other on the IoT-LoRa gateway board. Furthermore, prior to indoor and outdoor experiments, the ML-driven waterborne microplastic detection scheme with the LoRa communication system is trained and tested using camera-captured images and analog signal-converted images from the photodiode array. The ML-driven microplastic detection scheme can classify different types of microplastics in water, achieving an accuracy of 100% for all types of microplastics. The detection scheme is also capable of identifying the presence of microplastics in water, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.5%. The originality of this work lies in the use of ML algorithm to optimize the antenna design and to streamline identification and detection of microplastics in water.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2025.3639403","Thailand Science Research and Innovation Fundamental Fund Fiscal Year 2023(grant numbers:180249); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11272097","Internet of Things (IoT);LoRa antenna;LoRa communication system;machine learning (ML) model;microplastic;photodiode array","LoRa;Antennas;Patch antennas;Resonant frequency;Design methodology;Communication systems;Internet of Things;Optimization;Logic gates;Impedance matching","","","","30","IEEE","2 Dec 2025","1 Feb.1, 2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, in the interests of time, the floating point computation is approximated by integer computations where the integerization process requires a guess of an integer. Examples of this phenomenon include the discretization interval of /spl rho/ and /spl theta/ in the accumulator array in classical Hough transform, and in geometric manipulation of images (e.g., rotation, where a new grid is overlaid on the image). The result of incorrect discretization is a poor quality visual image, or worse, hampers measurements of critical parameters such as density or length in high fidelity machine vision. Correction techniques include, at best, anti-aliasing methods, or more commonly, a ""kludge"" to cleanup.

The geometric focus of these transducers limits the treatment envelope to the center of the brain, whereas the majority of cancers, especially metastases, occur along the periphery of the brain. In addition, these transducers create waves that impinge perpendicularly on the skull, which is inefficient. A normal incident transmission also sets up standing waves in the skull, which along with high attenuation leads to excess heating and a requirement for active cooling.

The electronic transport was governed by sequential tunneling at an applied bias above the global Coulomb blockade threshold, whereas in the Coulomb blockade regime, inelastic cotunneling was dominant up to 70 K, at which point it crossed over to activated behavior. The current dependence on the gate voltage that showed irregular oscillations was explained by the superimposition of Coulomb oscillation patterns generated by each different dot in the one-dimensional array.

The SAP expansion exerts tensile stress on the grooved chip sufficient to mechanically shatter it via Griffith's mode I crack propagation.

Basically, fluorescent micro- and nanospheres each conjugated with different proteins are size-dependently self-assembled (SDSA) onto these nanometer wells that were created on the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) substrate by electron beam lithography (EBL). Particles of different diameters are added serially, and electrostatically attached to the corresponding wells through electrostatic attraction between the carboxylic groups of the spheres and p-doped silicon substrate underneath the PMMA layer. Target detection utilizes fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from fluorescent beads to target (mouse immunoglobulin G = mIgG or Octamer-4 = Oct4) and its antibody bound on the beads. The 180 nm blue beads are conjugated with mIgG to capture anti-mIgG-FITC. The 50 nm green and 100 nm yellow-green beads are conjugated with anti-Oct4 to capture Oct4 peptides; where the secondary anti-Oct4 tagged with phycoerythrin via F(ab)2 fragment is then added to function as an indicator of Oct4 detection. These protein-conjugated particles are added serially from the largest to the smallest and the particles are successfully self-assembled to the respective nanometer wells to achieve size-dependent self-assembly. FRET signals are detected through fluorescence and confocal microscopes, and further confirmed by Fluorolog3 spectrofluorometer. Therefore, SDSA is a valuable approach for the fabrication of multiple components array; and FRET is a useful biorecognition technique for the detection of mIgG, Oct4 or other targets of interest.","","978-1-4244-3315-5","10.1109/ICCME.2009.4906682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4906682","","Fluorescence;Resonance;Energy exchange;Mice;Proteins;Self-assembly;Immune system;Electron beams;Lithography;Electrostatics","","","","25","IEEE","2 May 2009","9-11 April 2009","9-11 April 2009","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PU films were formulated with a collagen coating. Anti-adenoviral monoclonal antibodies were covalently bound to the collagen surface. These antibodies enabled tethering of replication defective adenoviruses through highly specific antigen-antibody affinity. We report for the first time successful PU filmbased gene delivery using antibody-tethered adenovirus encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), demonstrating efficient and highly localized gene delivery to arterial smooth muscle cells in cell culture. We conclude that PU film is a suitable platform for a localizable viral vector delivery system that also prevents systemic spread of vector.

While machine learning has emerged as a predominant method for pattern detection, the training process is intricate due to the severe scarcity of malicious code samples. Consequently, machine learning detectors often encounter malicious patterns in limited and isolated scenarios, hindering their ability to generalize effectively across diverse threat landscapes. In this paper, we introduce MalCoder, a novel method for synthesizing malicious code samples. MalCoder enlarges the quantity and diversity of malicious instances by transplanting a set of malicious prototypes into a vast pool of benign code, thereby crafting a diverse array of malicious instances tailored to various application scenarios. For each malware prototype, MalCoder treats it as an incomplete code fragment and crafts its preceding and subsequent contexts through right-to-left and left-to-right code completion respectively. By leveraging GPTs with various sampling strategies, we can instantiate a large number of code samples bearing the malware prototype. Subsequently, MalCoder masks the original prototypes within the transplanted samples and fine-tunes an LLM code generator to reconstruct the original prototype. This process enables the model to seamlessly transplant malicious code fragments into benign code. During inference, MalCoder can automatically insert malicious fragments into benign samples at random positions, transforming benign code into malicious code. We apply MalCoder to a large pool of benign code in CodeSearchNet and craft over 50,000 malicious samples stemming from 39 malicious prototypes. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the generated samples maintain key characteristics of malicious code while blending seamlessly with benign code, which helps in creating realistic and varied training data. Additionally, by using the generated samples as augmented training data, we witness a remarkable surge in malicious code detection capabilities. Specifically, the F1-score experiences a significant increase compared to utilizing only the original prototype samples.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2025.3633280","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB4503802); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:25ZR1401175); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11250608","Malicious code generation;malicious code detection;code transplanting;program generation","Codes;Malware;Prototypes;Training;Feature extraction;Detectors;Reactive power;Machine learning;Source coding;Generators","","","","58","IEEE","17 Nov 2025","Jan. 2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main characteristic of the resulting online scheduling problem is the strong nexus between scheduling and placement. We discuss a fast online placement technique and then focus on scheduling real-time tasks. We devise guarantee-based schedulers for two scenarios, namely tasks with arbitrary and synchronous arrival times.

The key insight in this vulnerability is that speculative execution in processors can be misused to access the secrets. Subsequently, even though the speculatively executed instructions are squashed, the secret may linger in micro-architectural states such as cache, and can potentially be accessed by an attacker via side channels. In this paper, we propose oo7, a static analysis approach that can mitigate Spectre attacks by detecting potentially vulnerable code snippets in program binaries and protecting them against the attack by patching them. Our key contribution is to balance the concerns of effectiveness, analysis time and run-time overheads. We employ control flow extraction, taint analysis, and address analysis to detect tainted conditional branches and speculative memory accesses. oo7 can detect all fifteen purpose-built Spectre-vulnerable code patterns [1] , whereas Microsoft compiler with Spectre mitigation option can only detect two of them. We also report the results of a large-scale study on applying oo7 to over 500 program binaries (average binary size 261 KB) from different real-world projects. We protect programs against Spectre attack by selectively inserting fences only at vulnerable conditional branches to prevent speculative execution.

The current approaches to address the resource challenge is to create an index for the corpus to which the suspected source code is compared. The index creation, however, is very costly. If the analysis is done only once, it may not be worth the effort. This paper demonstrates how suffix trees can be used to obtain a scalable comparison.

Most of the current mechanisms specify variations on the architecture by adding or removing architectural elements. However, it is also necessary to specify variations inside components. In this paper, we propose the notion of plastic partial components to support internal variations.

Thus, the study of novel algorithmic strategies to optimize their implementation on current devices is an interesting topic to the GPU community. In this paper we focus on optimizing the reduction primitive, which merely reduces a data sequence into a single value using a binary associative operator. Although tree-based and sequential-based algorithms have been already implemented on GPUs, a comparison of both algorithm performance had not been carried out yet. Thus, our first contribution is to present an experimental study of state-of-the-art reduction algorithms on CUDA. Next we introduce two algorithmic optimizations that are integrated into the fastest solution (a sequential-based algorithm), improving its throughput even more. Finally, we replicate this methodology to the segmented version of the primitive, which applies when the input is composed of several independent segments. In this case, it is not clear which algorithm exhibits the best performance, since throughput deeply depends on the distribution of segments along the input. According to our results, tree-based algorithms run faster for small segments, while sequential methods are better for medium and large ones.","","978-1-4673-2362-8","10.1109/HPCSim.2012.6266966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6266966","parallel reduction;segmented parallel reduction;data-parallel algorithms;GPGPU;CUDA","Graphics processing unit;Kernel;Arrays;Instruction sets;Optimization;Synchronization;Throughput","","23","","17","IEEE","16 Aug 2012","2-6 July 2012","2-6 July 2012","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The HLT farm selects interesting events for storage and offline analysis at a rate of around 1 kHz. The DAQ system has been redesigned during the accelerator shutdown in 2013/14. The motivation is twofold: Firstly, the current compute nodes, networking, and storage infrastructure will have reached the end of their lifetime by the time the LHC restarts. Secondly, in order to handle higher LHC luminosities and event pileup, a number of sub-detectors will be upgraded, increasing the number of readout channels and replacing the off-detector readout electronics with a $\mu {\hbox {TCA}}$ implementation. The new DAQ architecture will take advantage of the latest developments in the computing industry. For data concentration, 10/40 Gb/s Ethernet technologies will be used, as well as an implementation of a reduced TCP/IP in FPGA for a reliable transport between custom electronics and commercial computing hardware. A Clos network based on 56 Gb/s FDR Infiniband has been chosen for the event builder with a throughput of $\sim 4~\hbox{Tb/s}$ . The HLT processing is entirely file based. This allows the DAQ and HLT systems to be independent, and to use the HLT software in the same way as for the offline processing. The fully built events are sent to the HLT with 1/10/40 Gb/s Ethernet via network file systems. Hierarchical collection of HLT accepted events and monitoring meta-data are stored into a global file system.

The latter capability was provided with the aid of reloadable RAM-based blocks. To illustrate the capabilities of the tools suggested, four design examples are discussed. Additional materials for this paper are available in the form of a number of tutorials and projects for FPGAs that can be accessed through the Internet.","","0-7695-2003-0","10.1109/DSD.2003.1231939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231939","","Software libraries;Digital circuits;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Design automation;Computer interfaces;Digital systems;Data visualization;Debugging;Internet","","11","1","12","IEEE","15 Sep 2003","1-6 Sept. 2003","1-6 Sept. 2003","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, compilers treat them like ordinary APIs utilized by an otherwise sequential host language. Their parallel control flow remains hidden within opaque runtime library calls which are embedded within a sequential intermediate representation lacking the concepts of parallelism. Consequently, the tuning and coordination of parallelism is clearly beyond the scope of conventional optimizing compilers and hence left to the programmer or the runtime system. The main objective of the Insieme compiler is to overcome this limitation by utilizing INSPIRE, a unified, parallel, highlevel intermediate representation. Instead of mapping parallel constructs and APIs to external routines, their behavior is modeled explicitly using a unified and fixed set of parallel language constructs. Making the parallel control flow accessible to the compiler lays the foundation for the development of reusable, static and dynamic analyses and transformations bridging the gap between a variety of parallel paradigms. Within this paper we describe the structure of INSPIRE and elaborate the considerations which influenced its design. Furthermore, we demonstrate its expressiveness by illustrating the encoding of a variety of parallel language constructs and we evaluate its ability to preserve performance relevant aspects of input codes.","1089-795X","978-1-4799-1021-2","10.1109/PACT.2013.6618799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6618799","Compiler;Intermediate Representation;Parallel Computation;High-level Program Analysis","Instruction sets;Arrays;Abstracts;Runtime;Tuning;Optimization;Parallel processing","","11","","36","IEEE","3 Oct 2013","7-11 Sept. 2013","7-11 Sept. 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim is to reduce raw ECAL data to a level acceptable by the CMS DAQ system. For each positive level 1 trigger, the SRP is guided by trigger primitive generation electronics to identify ECAL regions with energy deposition satisfying certain programmable criteria. It then directs the ECAL read-out electronics to apply predefined zero suppression levels to the crystal data, depending whether the crystals fall within these regions or not. About 200 of high speed 1.6 Gbit/s I/O channels, asynchronous operation at up to 100 kHz level 1 trigger rate, a stringent real-time requirement of 5 /spl mu/s latency and flexibility in choice of selection algorithms are the main challenges of the SRP application. The architecture adopted for the SRP is based on modern parallel optic pluggable modules and high density FPGA devices with embedded processors and multi-gigabit transceivers. Implementation studies to validate proposed solutions are presented. The performance of envisaged selection algorithms is investigated with the CMS detector simulation software. The robustness of optical communication channels is estimated via direct measurements and calculations. The feasibility to perform data reduction operations within the allocated timing budget is verified by running a representative SRP firmware on a development board with a Xilinx Virtex2Pro FPGA device.","1082-3654","0-7803-8701-5","10.1109/NSSMIC.2004.1462573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1462573","","Collision mitigation;Field programmable gate arrays;Large Hadron Collider;Data acquisition;Crystals;Delay;Application software;Computer architecture;High speed optical techniques;Optical devices","","6","","9","IEEE","1 Aug 2005","16-22 Oct. 2004","16-22 Oct. 2004","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach uses a single pass of source-level analysis to recognize a common pattern among dense matrix computations. It then tags the recognized patterns to trigger a sequence of general-purpose compiler optimizations specially composed for them. We show that by allowing different optimizations to adequately communicate with each other through a set of coordination handles and dynamic tags inserted inside the optimized code, we can specialize the composition of general-purpose compiler optimizations to attain a level of performance comparable to those of manually written assembly code by experts, thereby allowing selected computations in applications to benefit from similar levels of optimizations as those manually applied by experts.","2379-3155","978-1-4799-6998-2","10.1109/MICRO.2014.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011420","Computers and information processing;Computer science;Programming;Automatic programming","Optimization;Arrays;Kernel;Pattern recognition;Runtime;Libraries;Safety","","6","","33","IEEE","19 Jan 2015","13-17 Dec. 2014","13-17 Dec. 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those attempts followed by performance evaluation are repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. The task of performance tuning requires a great deal of time and effort. On account of combinatorial explosion of possible attempts, scientists/tuning experts have a tendency to make decisions on what to be explored just based on their intuition or good sense of tuning. We advocate evidence-based performance tuning (EBT) that facilitates the use of database of facts extracted from tuning histories of applications to guide the exploration of the search space. However, in general, performance tuning is conducted as transient tasks without version control systems. Tuning histories may lack explicit facts about what kind of program transformation contributed to the better performance or even about the chronological order of the source code snapshots. For reconstructing the missing information, we employ a state-of-the-art fine-grained change pattern identification tool for inferring applied transformation patterns only from an unordered set of source code snapshots. The extracted facts are intended to be stored and queried for further data mining.

In a dynamic Web application, multiple versions of client code in HTML and JavaScript are dynamically generated from server-side code at run time for different usage scenarios. Toward understanding refactoring for dynamic Web code, we conducted an empirical study on several PHP-based Web applications. We found that Web developers perform a new type of refactoring that is specific to PHP-based dynamic Web code and pertain to output client-side code. After such a refactoring, the server-side code is more compact and modular with less amount of embedded and inline client-side HTML/JS code, or produces more standard-conforming client-side code. However, the corresponding output client-side code of the server code before and after the refactoring provides the same external behavior. We call it output-oriented refactoring. Our finding in the study motivates us to build WebDyn, an automatic tool for dynamicalizing refactorings. When performing on a portion of server-side code (which might contain both PHP and embedded/inline HTML/JS code), WebDyn detects the repeated and varied parts in that code portion and produces dynamic PHP code that creates the same client-side code.

To handle the incomplete data set which gradually increases during sequencing time, all-against-all comparisons are broken down into successive window-against-window comparison phases and executed using a novel dynamic suffix comparison algorithm combined with a partitioned dynamic programming method. The complete system has been designed to facilitate parallel processing in hardware, which allows real-time comparison and full scalability as well as a decrease in the number of computations required.

Such combined attacks manage to bypass the existing countermeasures of several versions of JCVMs. This paper proposes an approach for detecting mutant applets, as soon as they appear at runtime, hence revealing and thwarting an ongoing attack. The approach is completely transparent to the applet's developer, and only a limited (a priori computable) amount of resources are used at runtime, hence it is affordable on board of smart cards.

Investigating alarms to find out whether they are true errors which have to be fixed, or whether they are false alarms can cause significant effort. The key idea of this work is to apply model-based testing to automatically find test vectors for alarms reported by the static analyzer. When a test vector reproducing the error has been found, it has been proven that it is a true error, when no error has been found with EmbeddedTester's model checking-based CV engine, it has been proven to be a false alarm. This can significantly reduce the alarm analysis effort and reduces the level of expertise needed to perform the code-level software verification.","","978-1-4673-9289-1","10.1109/EDCC.2015.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371951","static analysis;abstract interpretation;run-time error analysis;model-based testing;test vector generation","Software;Analytical models;Arrays;Context;Error analysis;Couplings","","2","","29","IEEE","7 Jan 2016","7-11 Sept. 2015","7-11 Sept. 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nonetheless, most Grid and local resource management systems still use the queuing approach because of the additional complexity introduced by advance reservation. A planning based resource management system has to keep track of the reservations in the future and needs a good overview on the available capacity during the negotiation of incoming reservations. For advance reservation, the resource management problem becomes a two dimensional problem. In this paper different data structures are investigated and discussed in order to fit to planning based resource management. As a result the benefits of using lists of resource allocation or free blocks are exposed. This general idea widely used to manage continuous resources is extended to cover not only the resource dimension but also the time dimension. The list of blocks approach is evaluated in a Grid level and a resource level resource management system. The extensive simulations showed a better runtime and higher reservation success rate compared with the currently favored approach of a slotted time.","1550-6533","978-0-7695-4573-8","10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2011.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6106021","Grid Computing;Advance Reservation;Resource Management","Resource management;Schedules;Runtime;Arrays;Clustering algorithms","","2","","21","IEEE","19 Dec 2011","26-29 Oct. 2011","26-29 Oct. 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the primary purpose of the language FlexT development was to make the binary data understandable by displaying them according to the format specifications, recently we have implemented the code generator, which can produce data reading code in some imperative languages from the specifications. By now we have implemented the code generation for the most widely used FlexT data types, but some complex types like that used in specifications of machine instructions' encoding are not supported yet. The current capabilities of the code generator are well characterized by that it have successfully produced a full-featured data reader code for the well-known for the GIS community Shape file format.

In many cases, working on such an application involves a wide range of programming activities such as 3D graphics, networking, user interfaces and audio programming. At the same time, such applications are usually real time and performance critical. The complexity of developing such an application comes from two sources: first, the programming language used in development with its strengths and also the limitations it imposes. The second is the requirements of the virtual environment itself, with its dynamics and size. Some languages are more suitable than others for any given application domain, but in general once a programming language is selected, the main focus is the application itself and not the language used. This paper presents an approach where a virtual environment (CVE) and its implementation language (Unicon) evolved together over the course of the project development, derived from emerging functional and performance requirements. The Unicon language was improved and new features were added over time to meet new demands and address the complexities that arose at the application level. This approach was combined with developing a framework to build virtual worlds with a social integrated development environment and to populate those worlds with non-player characters.","","978-1-4577-1453-5","10.1109/CW.2011.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6079346","language design;cve;3D models;social IDE;object selection;language-application codesign;virtual worlds","Three dimensional displays;Graphics;Arrays;Solid modeling;Computer languages;Libraries;Load modeling","","1","","11","IEEE","17 Nov 2011","4-6 Oct. 2011","4-6 Oct. 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When a processing element gets reconfigured using one with a different architecture, heterogeneity spans the temporal dimension, too. Now, the question arises how could this type of heterogeneity be managed at run time. This paper analyzes the challenges of such an adaptive SoC. We show that many of the requirements for an FPGA-based realization are met by the SDVM, the Scalable Dataflow-driven Virtual Machine which has been successfully implemented and tested on a cluster of workstations. Focusing on run time reconfiguration, the SDVM has evolved to a virtualization layer for multicore systems based on FPGAs, now called SDVMR.

Most scientific applications today rely heavily on disk I/O for out-of-core computations, checkpointing, and visualization of data. To reduce excess energy consumption on disk system, prior studies proposed several hardware or OS-based disk power management schemes. While such schemes have been known to be effective in certain cases, they might miss opportunities for better energy savings due to their reactive nature. While compiler based schemes can make more accurate decisions on a given application by extracting disk access patterns statically, the lack of runtime information on the status of shared disks may lead to wrong decisions when multiple applications exercise the same set of disks concurrently. In this paper, we propose a runtime system based approach that provides more effective disk power management. In our scheme, the compiler provides crucial information on the future disk access patterns and preferred disk speeds from the perspective of individual applications, and a runtime system uses this information along with current state of the shared disks to make decisions that are agreeable to all applications. We implemented our runtime system support within PVFS2, a parallel file system. Our experimental results with four I/O-intensive scientific applications indicate large energy savings: 19.4% and 39.9% over the previously-proposed pure software and pure hardware based schemes, respectively. We further show in this paper that our scheme can achieve consistent energy savings with a varying number and mix of applications and different disk layouts of data.","2168-9253","978-1-4244-1387-4","10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4629226","","Runtime;Layout;File systems;Hardware;Niobium;Arrays;Program processors","","1","","35","IEEE","19 Sep 2008","17-20 Sept. 2007","17-20 Sept. 2007","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Excalibur, a multi-modal (example and natural language description) and interactive synthesizer for code search. Excalibur ensures that the generated programs are correct for the provided examples (soundness) and include the user-intended program (bounded completeness). Furthermore, Excalibur helps the user identify the user-intended program through question-answer interaction. To minimize the required interaction efforts, question selection is crucial. To improve question selection for code search, we propose probabilistic version spaces (ProbVS), in which the user-intended program’s probability is high and others are low. ProbVS combines traditional version spaces for compactly representing extensive programs and large language models (on the user-provided natural language description) for adjusting programs’ probabilities to align with users’ intents. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 44 tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of Excalibur and ProbVS and demystified how ProbVS affects probability distributions and how the configurable parameters affect ProbVS.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2025.3565387","Hong Kong Research Grant Council/General Research Fund(grant numbers:16205821); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62272218); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant(grant numbers:RGPIN-2022-03744,DGECR-2022-00378); FRQNT/NSERC NOVA program(grant numbers:2024-NOVA-346499); Leading-Edge Technology Program of the Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:BK20202001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10979773","Program synthesis;question selection problem;large language model","Codes;Arrays;Probability distribution;Probabilistic logic;Overfitting;Natural languages;Encoding;Search problems;Java;Estimation","","","","68","IEEE","29 Apr 2025","June 2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, since the potential amount of behavioral variants to be formed is huge, it is substantially unlikely to ensure all of them are type safe due to the unnecessary variants which are not used at all. To address this problem, we propose an annotation-based approach to variability. It can type check the entire program consisting of base program and many variations only once, without resulting from each variant individually. We extend the Featherweight Java to formally prove that all the expected variants are still well typed. Moreover, the type system guarantees type safety of the updated program as one variant evolves to another and type correctness that no run-time errors occur.","","978-1-5090-0154-5","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363102","runtime adaptation;granule;annotation-based variability;dynamic evolution;featherweight java;type checking","Context;Runtime;Java;Explosions;Software systems;Proposals;Arrays","","","","19","IEEE","28 Dec 2015","26-28 Oct. 2015","26-28 Oct. 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A microarray is an orderly arrangement of thousands of DNA fragments where each DNA fragment is a probe (or a fingerprint) of a gene/cDNA. It is important that each probe must uniquely associate with a particular gene/cDNA. Otherwise, the performance of the microarray will be affected. Existing algorithms usually select probes using the criteria of homogeneity, sensitivity, and specificity. Moreover, they improve efficiency employing some heuristics. Such approaches reduce the accuracy. Instead, we make use of some smart filtering techniques to avoid redundant computation while maintaining the accuracy.

By providing prominent features such as variant peripheral support and flexibility to partial or major design modifications, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are commonly used to implement either an entire embedded system or a hardware description language-based processor, known as soft-core processor. FPGA-based designs, however, suffer from high power consumption, large die area, and low performance that hinders common use of soft-core processors in low-power embedded systems. In this paper, we present an efficient reconfigurable architecture to implement soft-core embedded processors in SRAM-based FPGAs by using characteristics such as low utilization and fragmented accessibility of comprising units. To this end, we integrate the low utilized functional units into efficiently designed look-up table (LUT)-based reconfigurable units (RUs). To further improve the efficiency of the proposed architecture, we used a set of efficient configurable hard logics that implement frequent Boolean functions while the other functions will still be employed by LUTs. We have evaluated effectiveness of the proposed architecture by implementing the Berkeley RISC-V processor and running MiBench benchmarks. We have also examined the applicability of the proposed architecture on an alternative open-source processor (i.e., LEON2) and a digital signal processing core. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture as compared to the conventional LUT-based soft-core processors improves area footprint, static power, energy consumption, and total execution time by 30.7%, 32.5%, 36.9%, and 6.3%, respectively.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2018.2812118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8316989","Field programmable gate arrays;microprocessors;partial reconfiguration;power dissipation;reconfigurable logic;soft-core processors","Program processors;Field programmable gate arrays;Embedded systems;Table lookup;Switches;Power demand","","27","","62","IEEE","15 Mar 2018","March 2019","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In visualization of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in particular, input data sets today can surpass 100 Gbytes, and are expected to scale with the ability of supercomputers to generate them. Some visualization tools already partition large data sets into segments, and load appropriate segments as they are needed. However, this does not remove the problem for two reasons: 1) there are data sets for which even the individual segments are too large for the largest graphics workstations, 2) many practitioners do not have access to workstations with the memory capacity required to load even a segment, especially since the state-of-the-art visualization tools tend to be developed by researchers with much more powerful machines. When the size of the data that must be accessed is larger than the size of memory, some form of virtual memory is simply required. This may be by segmentation, paging, or by paged segments. The authors demonstrate that complete reliance on operating system virtual memory for out-of-core visualization leads to egregious performance. They then describe a paged segment system that they have implemented, and explore the principles of memory management that can be employed by the application for out-of-core visualization. They show that application control over some of these can significantly improve performance. They show that sparse traversal can be exploited by loading only those data actually required.","","0-8186-8262-0","10.1109/VISUAL.1997.663888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=663888","","Data visualization;Computational fluid dynamics;Operating systems;Power engineering and energy;NASA;Software tools;Memory management","","178","1","28","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","24-24 Oct. 1997","24-24 Oct. 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the drop of the raw silicon cost posed some questions on the profitability of recycling, the PV community needs to work hard on this topic for developing more efficient and environmental friendly recycling systems. For recycling glass and silicon of end-of-life solar modules, it is necessary to separate them from the plastic materials used for laminating the panel.

Programmers must address issues such as process decomposition, synchronization, and load balancing. We have developed a parallelizing compiler that, given a sequential program and a memory layout of its data, performs process decomposition while balancing parallelism against locality of reference. A process decomposition is obtained by specializing the program for each processor to the data that resides on that processor. If this analysis fails, the compiler falls back to a simple but inefficient scheme called run-time resolution. Each process's role in the computation is determined by examining the data required for execution at run-time. Thus, our approach to process decomposition is data-driven rather than program-driven. We discuss several message optimizations that address the issues of overhead and synchronization in message transmission. Accumulation reorganizes the computation of a commutative and associative operator to reduce message traffic. Pipelining sends a value as close to its computation as possible to increase parallelism. Vectorization of messages combines messages with the same source and the same destination to reduce overhead. Our results from experiments in parallelizing SIMPLE, a large hydrodynamics benchmark, for the Intel iPSC/2, show a speedup within 60% to 70% of handwritten code.<>","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.277789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=277789","","Memory architecture;Parallel processing;Runtime;High level languages;Parallel machines;Programming profession;Load management;Program processors;Failure analysis;Commutation","","28","1","35","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","March 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Software Safety Certification Tool for Automatically Generated Guidance, Navigation and Control Code","E. Denney; S.

Many NASA projects now use MathWorks Simulink and Real- Time Workshop for at least some of their modeling and code development. The trend is to move beyond simulation and prototyping to actual flight code, particularly in the Guidance, Navigation, and Control domain. However, there are substantial obstacles to more widespread adoption of code generators in such safety-critical domains. Since code generators are typically not qualified, there is no guarantee that their output is correct, and consequently the generated code still needs to be fully tested and certified. Moreover, the regeneration of code can require complete recertification, which offsets many of the advantages of using a generator. Indeed, manual review of autocode can be more challenging than for hand-written code. Since the direct V&V of code generators is too laborious and complicated due to their complex (and often proprietary) nature, we have developed a generator plug-in to support the subsequent certification of the code that is generated. Specifically, the AutoCert tool supports certification by formally verifying that the generated code is free of different safety violations, by constructing an independently verifiable certificate, and by explaining its analysis in a textual form suitable for code reviews. This enables missions to obtain assurance about the safety and reliability of the code without excessive manual V&V effort and, as a consequence, increases the acceptance of code generators in safety-critical contexts. The generation of explicit certificates and textual reports is particularly well-suited to supporting independent V&V. The key technical idea of our approach is to exploit the idiomatic nature of auto-generated code in order to automatically infer logical annotations. These allow the automatic formal verification of the safety properties without requiring access to the internals of the code generator. The approach is independent of the particular generator used but is currently being adapted to code generated using MathWorks Real-Time Workshop, an automatic code generator that translates from Simulink/Stateflow models into embedded C code.","1095-323X","978-1-4244-1487-1","10.1109/AERO.2008.4526576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4526576","","Software safety;Certification;Navigation;Automatic generation control;NASA;Aerospace simulation;Virtual prototyping;Automatic control;Testing;Automatic programming","","27","","12","IEEE","20 May 2008","1-8 March 2008","1-8 March 2008","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because most of the current approaches rely on syntactic rather than semantic information, they do not provide sufficient support for software understanding. This paper proposes a new semi-automated approach for concern identification specifically designed to support software understanding, which starts from a set of related variables and uses static dataflow information to determine the concern skeleton, a data-oriented abstraction of a concern. We discuss the application of this approach to the JHotDraw case-study, the de facto standard benchmark for concern identification, and show that it can be used to identify a significant number of concerns, including several concerns not previously discussed in the existing literature.","1534-5351","978-1-4244-2157-2","10.1109/CSMR.2008.4493314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4493314","concern identification;program understanding;feature extraction;dataflow analysis","Software systems;Software maintenance;Skeleton;Encapsulation;Costs;Software design;Application software;Feature extraction;Data analysis;Computer science","","15","","21","IEEE","18 Apr 2008","1-4 April 2008","1-4 April 2008","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to vector processing, parallel computing is now considered a useful way to enhance performance. However, parallel computing tends to be unpopular among users because, with presently available technology and software, it requires explicit programmer intervention to exploit architectural parallelism. This intervention can be minor in some cases, but it often requires a nonnegligible amount of program restructuring, or even a reformulation of some of the algorithms used. In addition, it makes program debugging considerably more difficult. Tools for interprocedural program analysis, able to analyze at high levels large FORTRAN programs composed of many subroutines and to perform an automatic high-level parallel decomposition, are being developed at IBM. As an additional possibility, low-level parallelism could also be exploited automatically. This would greatly simplify the program analysis needed in a compiler in order to automatically insert parallel constructs in a program. However, this could only be efficient in an environment in which the cost for scheduling and synchronizing parallel activities is extremely small. Such a “microtasking” environment has been realized, at a prototype level, for IBM multiprocessors and is described in this paper. Its applicability and potential are illustrated with the help of some simple examples. These examples show that, with microtasking, good processor utilization and useful speed-ups are achieved even for fine-grain problems. The user interface of the prototype is described, both at the FORTRAN and at the Assembler level, and the possibility of incorporating this environment into a FORTRAN compiler is discussed.","0018-8646","","10.1147/rd.306.0574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5390160","","","","10","1","","","6 Apr 2010","Nov. 1986","","IBM","IBM Journals"

The open components are installed (executed) on an insecure machine while the hidden components are installed (executed) on a secure machine. We assume that while open components can be stolen, to obtain a fully functioning copy of the software, the hidden components must be recovered. We describe an algorithm that constructs hidden components by slicing the original software components. We argue that recovery of hidden components constructed through slicing, in order to obtain a fully functioning copy of the software, is a complex task. We further develop security analysis to capture the complexity of recovering hidden components. Finally we apply our technique to several large Java programs to study the complexity of recovering constructed hidden components and to measure the runtime overhead introduced by splitting of software into open and hidden components.","","0-7695-1913-X","10.1109/CGO.2003.1191556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191556","","Pervasive computing;Computer crime;Application software;Smart cards;Computer industry;Runtime;Mobile computing;Protection;Computer science;Costs","","10","7","22","IEEE","2 Apr 2003","23-26 March 2003","23-26 March 2003","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, the visualization had to be eloquent to a nonexpert user. This was achieved by first designing and computing a finite-element analysis (FEA) simulation of the impact between the aircraft and the top 20 stories of the building and then by visualizing the FEA results with a state-of-the-art commercial animation system. The visualization was enabled by an automatic translator that converts the simulation data into an animation system 3D scene. We built upon a previously developed translator. The translator was substantially extended to enable and control visualization of fire and of disintegrating elements to better scale with the number of nodes and the number of states to handle beam elements with complex profiles and to handle smoothed particle hydrodynamics liquid representation.

It transforms a multi-threaded program into a corresponding sequential one and then uses a fault-diagnosis method suitable for this type of program, in order to localize faults. The code transformation is implemented with rules and context switch information from counterexamples, which are typically generated by bounded model checkers.

The reason for this is that these environments allow attackers to exploit small timing differences down to clock cycle accuracy. On the defensive side it is therefore advisable to evaluate cautiously if security-critical code contains data dependent timing discrepancies. When working with real hardware, testing for such vulnerabilities is a tedious process. In order to reduce the burden of vetting, we study approaches that allow cycle-accurate behavioral emulation of relevant CPU behavior such as instruction pipeline flushes and bus contention. We show that our approach is feasible and efficient by implementing an emulator of the popular ARM Cortex-M core. Then we give an overview about the problems of cycle-accurate emulation and demonstrate our approach towards a cycle-accurate ARM Thumb-2 simulator. Finally, we show how this simulator can be integrated into the build process of firmware to check for the presence of timing side channels before the system is deployed.","","978-1-5090-0990-9","10.1109/ARES.2016.94","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7784555","timing side channel;cycle accurate;emulation;simulation","Timing;Clocks;Hardware;Emulation;Optimization;Random access memory;Security","","4","","20","IEEE","15 Dec 2016","31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In AAS, however, varying traffic concentrations can be flexibly handled by dynamic cell densification, e.g. by splitting a sector into smaller “sub-sectors”. Vertical sectorization is a well-known approach where a conventional sector is split vertically in to two, inner and outer sectors, resulting in 3×2 sectors per site for AAS-based tri-sectorized site. In this paper work, an alternative vertical sectorization deployment configuration is presented where the inner sectors build a so called super-cell resulting from transmitting the same cell information in all inner sectors. Investigation results show that the super-cell configuration can mitigate unwanted back and side lobe effects in close proximity of the site and, therefore, provides a significant gain for users in this coverage area.","1938-1883","978-1-4799-2003-7","10.1109/ICC.2014.6884129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6884129","Active Antenna Systems;Vertical Sectorization;Super-cell;Mobility","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Antenna radiation patterns;Standards;Wireless communication;Throughput","","3","","11","IEEE","28 Aug 2014","10-14 June 2014","10-14 June 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cache compression can increase effective cache capacity and reduce misses, improve performance, and potentially reduce system energy. However, previous compressed cache designs have demonstrated only limited benefits due to internal fragmentation and limited tags. In this paper, we propose the Decoupled Compressed Cache (DCC), which exploits spatial locality to improve both the performance and energy-efficiency of cache compression. DCC uses decoupled super-blocks and non-contiguous sub-block allocation to decrease tag overhead without increasing internal fragmentation. Non-contiguous sub-blocks also eliminate the need for energy-expensive re-compaction when a block's size changes. Compared to earlier compressed caches, DCC increases normalized effective capacity to a maximum of 4 and an average of 2.2 for a wide range of workloads. A further optimized Co-DCC (Co-Compacted DCC) design improves the average normalized effective capacity to 2.6 by co-compacting the compressed blocks in a super-block. Our simulations show that DCC nearly doubles the benefits of previous compressed caches with similar area overhead. We also demonstrate a practical DCC design based on a recent commercial LLC design.","","978-1-4503-2638-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7847615","Compression;Cache Design;Multicore;Energy Efficiency","Multicore processing;Computers;Energy efficiency;Complexity theory;Compression algorithms;Transistors;Runtime","","3","1","39","","9 Feb 2017","7-11 Dec. 2013","7-11 Dec. 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a chip multiprocessor-based execution environment, while it is possible to hide the overhead of code duplication through parallelism, hiding the memory space overhead incurred by data duplication is more difficult.

The proposed approach achieves this goal by using the memory locations that hold dead data to store the duplicates of the actively-used data. In this way, instead of using extra memory storage for duplicate elements, we use the existing memory locations to the extent allowed by usage patterns of data. The results collected from our experiments clearly show that the proposed approach saves significant memory space, as compared to a straightforward approach that implements full duplication","2158-3927","0-7695-2607-1","10.1109/DSN.2006.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1633491","","Parallel processing;Embedded computing;Optimizing compilers;Computer science;Data engineering;Reliability engineering;Network-on-a-chip;Silicon;Computer architecture;Sun","","1","","32","IEEE","10 Jul 2006","25-28 June 2006","25-28 June 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The REXA VM, which can virtualize embedded systems and sensor nodes and includes a general machine learning framework that supports arbitrary dynamic artificial neural network and decision tree models, is introduced in this study. The models are delivered as text files with highly compressed program code that are enclosed in code frames with embedded data (model parameters). The VM offers fundamental computations for ANN and DT models (Microservices). Using a decompiler, models can be updated (retrained) and sent to other nodes (mobile models). It can be demonstrated that virtualization using a bytecode machine and just-in-time compiler is still appropriate and effective for extremely low-resource processors.","","979-8-3503-1635-3","10.1109/FiCloud58648.2023.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10410676","Virtualization;Virtual Machines;Tiny ML;Sensor Networks;Embedded Systems;Microservices","Codes;Microcontrollers;Computational modeling;Artificial neural networks;Data models;Internet of Things;Virtualization","","1","","14","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","14-16 Aug. 2023","14-16 Aug. 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The tool RefDiff can achieve this supporting multiple programming languages. It provides a good precision, but at the cost of a large number of false negative results due to the necessary use of a high threshold in refactoring candidate selection. We have created a result checker that improves the overall performance of RefDiff by including more candidates and reducing false positives from RefDiff detection results afterwards. The checker encodes the textual differences (so-called diffs) corresponding to the results and uses machine learning to predict the contained refactoring type. The main contribution of this paper is the approach for extracting the diffs from the detection results and encoding them as image data for machine learning processing, as well as the training of the machine learning algorithm. We have shown that lowering the candidate threshold in conjunction with the checker improves not only the recall of RefDiff, also the precision is increased. Our approach improves the RefDiff detection results to 99.5% precision and 95.2% recall.","2470-6892","978-1-6654-9609-4","10.1109/SCAM55253.2022.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10006881","refactoring;detection;diff;features;encoding","Training;Deep learning;Computer languages;Software maintenance;Machine learning algorithms;Codes;Image coding","","1","","29","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","3-3 Oct. 2022","3-3 Oct. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pikus",NA,The Art of Writing Efficient Programs: An advanced programmer's guide to efficient hardware utilization and compiler optimizations using C++ examples,"","2021","","","","","Become a better programmer with performance improvement techniques such as concurrency, lock-free programming, atomic operations, parallelism, and memory managementKey FeaturesLearn proven techniques from a heavyweight and recognized expert in C++ and high-performance computingUnderstand the limitations of modern CPUs and their performance impactFind out how you can avoid writing inefficient code and get the best optimizations from the compilerLearn the tradeoffs and costs of writing high-performance programsBook DescriptionThe great free lunch of ""performance taking care of itself"" is over. Until recently, programs got faster by themselves as CPUs were upgraded, but that doesn't happen anymore. The clock frequency of new processors has almost peaked, and while new architectures provide small improvements to existing programs, this only helps slightly. To write efficient software, you now have to know how to program by making good use of the available computing resources, and this book will teach you how to do that. The Art of Efficient Programming covers all the major aspects of writing efficient programs, such as using CPU resources and memory efficiently, avoiding unnecessary computations, measuring performance, and how to put concurrency and multithreading to good use. You'll also learn about compiler optimizations and how to use the programming language (C++) more efficiently. Finally, you'll understand how design decisions impact performance. By the end of this book, you'll not only have enough knowledge of processors and compilers to write efficient programs, but you'll also be able to understand which techniques to use and what to measure while improving performance. At its core, this book is about learning how to learn.What you will learnDiscover how to use the hardware computing resources in your programs effectivelyUnderstand the relationship between memory order and memory barriersFamiliarize yourself with the performance implications of different data structures and organizationsAssess the performance impact of concurrent memory accessed and how to minimize itDiscover when to use and when not to use lock-free programming techniquesExplore different ways to improve the effectiveness of compiler optimizationsDesign APIs for concurrent data structures and high-performance data structures to avoid inefficienciesWho this book is forThis book is for experienced developers and programmers who work on performance-critical projects and want to learn new techniques to improve the performance of their code. Programmers in algorithmic trading, gaming, bioinformatics, computational genomics, or computational fluid dynamics communities will get the most out of the examples in this book, but the techniques are fairly universal. Although this book uses the C++ language, the concepts demonstrated in the book can be easily transferred or applied to other compiled languages such as C, Java, Rust, Go, and more.","","9781800202740","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10162144.pdf&bkn=10162144&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","27 Jun 2023","","","Packt Publishing","Packt Publishing eBooks"

Such systems try to optimize the objective for both performance and power with mobile devices. Embedded application developers will then devise designs to optimize embedded applications for not only performance but also power. However, currently there are no power metrics support for popular application design platforms such as QEMU and SID, where application developers develop their applications. This hinders application developers to help tune optimizations for power. In this paper, we propose a power aware simulation framework on embedded multicore DSP subsystems for SID framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to attempt to build a power aware simulator based on SID simulation framework. The power estimation flow includes two phases, IP level power modeling and system level power power profiling. In the IP level power modeling, PowerMixerIP is employed to build up the power model for PAC DSP and major IPs. In the system level power profiling, we provide a power profiling hierarchy that meets the demand of embedded software developers. The granularity of power profiling can be configured to the whole simulation stage or any specific time slot in the simulation such as a dedicated function loop. In our experiments, DSP programs with SIMD intrinsics for DSPStone benchmark are examined with our proposed power aware simulator. In addition, a face detection application is deployed as a running example on multi-core DSP systems to show how our power simulator can be used to help collaborate with developers in the optimization process to illustrate views of power dissipations of applications.","","978-1-6055-8905-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751529","Multicore Simulation;Power;Embedded Processor;DSP","Multicore processing;Random access memory;Artificial neural networks;Digital signal processing;Switches","","","","31","","15 Apr 2011","24-29 Oct. 2010","24-29 Oct. 2010","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A typical multicast network consists of a single tree, in which only a few internal nodes contribute most resources and are involved in performing the multicast functionality. This leads to an un-even utilization of network resources. This problem is more prominent in MANETs where network resources are limited. A possible solution to the problem is to split the multicast content over a number of trees. Multiple trees provide several paths for the multicast content and get more nodes involved in implementing the multicast functionality. However, in such a setup, not all the trees get to use the best weight edges, thus the overall multicast latency increases. This paper presents MEST, a distributed algorithm to construct multiple edge-sharing trees for small group multicast. MEST balances the resource allocation and delay constraints by choosing to overlap certain edges that have low weights. Our simulation results show that MEST is scalable and can generate multicast networks that have low delay and fair resource utilization.","2155-6814","0-7803-9465-8","10.1109/MAHSS.2005.1542821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542821","","Resource management;Delay;Tree graphs;Mobile ad hoc networks;Multicast protocols;Computer science;Network topology;Distributed algorithms;Graph theory;Wireless networks","","","","24","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","7-7 Nov. 2005","7-7 Nov. 2005","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present a framework which, starting from an ANSI C application code: (i) automatically identifies code fragments suitable for hardware implementation as specialized functional units (ii) for all these segments a synthesizable code is generated and sent to a synthesis tool, (iii) from the synthesis results, the segments to be implemented on FPGA are selected (iv) bit stream to configure the FPGA and modified C code to be executed on the CPU are generated.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), we observed the Extended Green Object (EGO) G19.01−0.03 with sub-arcsec resolution from 1.05 mm to 5.01 cm wavelengths. Our ∼0.4 arcsec ∼ 1600 au angular resolution ALMA observations reveal a velocity gradient across the millimetre core MM1, oriented perpendicular to the previously known bipolar molecular outflow, which is consistently traced by 20 lines of 8 molecular species with a range of excitation temperatures, including complex organic molecules (COMs). Kinematic modelling shows the data are well described by models that include a disc in Keplerian rotation and infall, with an enclosed mass of 40–70 M⊙ (within a 2000 au outer radius) for a disc inclination angle of i = 40○, of which 5.4–7.2 M⊙ is attributed to the disc. Our new VLA observations show that the 6.7 GHz Class II methanol masers associated with MM1 form a partial ellipse, consistent with an inclined ring, with a velocity gradient consistent with that of the thermal gas. The disc-to-star mass ratio suggests the disc is likely to be unstable and may be fragmenting into as-yet-undetected low-mass stellar companions. Modelling the centimetre–millimetre spectral energy distribution of MM1 shows the ALMA 1.05 mm continuum emission is dominated by dust, whilst a free–free component, interpreted as a hypercompact H ii region, is required to explain the VLA ∼5 cm emission. The high enclosed mass derived for a source with a moderate bolometric luminosity (∼104 L⊙) suggests that the MM1 disc may feed an unresolved high-mass binary system.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab2973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9648096","masers;techniques: interferometric;stars: formation;stars: individual: G19.01−0.03;stars: massive;stars: protostars","","","","","","","13 Dec 2021","Oct. 2021","","OUP","OUP Journals"

These goals are necessary to expedite and avoid improper fracture healing due to misalignment of the bone fragments. However, the rigidity of the screw, geometry of the fractured anatomy (e.g., femur and pelvis), and osteoporosis may cause an array of complications. To address these challenges, we propose the use of a continuum manipulator and a bendable medical screw (BMS) to drill curved tunnels and fixate the bone fragments. This novel approach provides the clinicians with a degree of freedom in selecting the drilling entry point as well as the navigation of drill in complex anatomical and osteoporotic bones. This technique can also facilitate the treatment of osteonecrosis and augmentation of the hip to prevent osteoporotic fractures. In this paper: 1) we evaluated the performance of the curved drilling technique on human cadaveric specimens by making several curved tunnels with different curvatures and 2) we also demonstrated the feasibility of internal fixation using the BMS versus a rigid straight screw by performing finite element simulation of fracture fixation in an osteoporotic femur.","2576-3202","","10.1109/TMRB.2019.2895780","NIH/NIBIB(grant numbers:R01EB016703); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8627979","Medical robots and systems;continuum manipulator;medical device design;orthopedic surgery","Bones;Fasteners;Tools;Manipulators;Head;DC motors","","65","","24","IEEE","27 Jan 2019","Feb. 2019","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve this goal, fishes, invertebrates, and phytoplankton were sampled in European seas and taxonomically classified. Fragments of their mitochondrial 16S, cyt b, and COI genes and from the nuclear 18S genes were sequenced and served as molecular markers to enable probe design for the microarrays. An on-line data base containing the sequences and all relevant information of the samples has been implemented. A first prototype of a ""Fish Chip"", is based on more than 400 sequences from the 16S rRNA gene belonging to 46 species. A second microarray prototype serves to identify flatfishes from the North Sea based on COI-and 16S sequences from 70 individuals of 17 fish species.

These antennas are constructed using a modular approach out of a series of identical boards which act as antenna pixels - electrically small segments that can be turned on and off to affect the antenna pattern. Each pixel contains RF switches and contacts for control wires on each side of the board. By fragmenting the reconfigurable antenna into individual pixel boards, one can construct antennas of arbitrary size and shape, allowing implementations to be designed for more gain or for a smaller footprint.

The Doppler shift in signals reflected from space debris causes a temporary offset of the response at the output of the receiving part. That makes systematic error that is necessary to compensate for more accurate measurement. Furthermore, for space debris radar detection and subsequent coordinates and velocities determination there is a need to ensure an adequate signal storage time that also determines the required energy characteristics.

In this study, we analyzed the electrophysiological impact of different RFA time duration strategies through a controlled animal protocol. Electrical activity of the isolated right atrium of rats, under different RFA time strategies on the epicardium, was acquired during 4 s on the endocardium by electrical Mapping (EM) and simultaneously on the endocardium by Optical Mapping (OM), respectively. Analyses were concentrated on both time and frequency domain, through analysis of sig-nal's morphology, local activation time, conduction velocity, dominant frequency (DF), and organization index (OI). The morphology of the optical and electrical signals was altered as the ablation time increased, making it difficult to identify activation times. Moreover, DF and OI decreased with increasing ablation time implied in fragmented electrograms.

In general, the satisfiability of CHC modulo theory of arithmetic is undecidable. Thus, solving them is a mix of science, art, and a dash of magic. In this tutorial, we explore several aspects of this problem. First, we illustrate how different problems are translated to CHC.

The application then dictates the microsensor system architecture and the nature of its components: As soon as the target analytes and their concentrations as well as the boundary conditions of detection are specified, the optimum transducer, the necessary driving and signal conditioning circuitry, as well as interface and communication units can be selected from the CMOS-toolbox, and the different modules can then be combined to arrive at a custom-designed monolithic CMOS microsensor system.

In this paper an algorithm for estimating the intensity in the oval slot of a metal plate placed cross in a rectangular waveguide is proposed. It is assumed that the edges of the slot are in the form of a semicircle and the fundamental wave mode is propagated in the rectangular waveguide. The intensity in the slot is determined by an area integral. The integral area consist of a central fragment and two semicircular parts. The resolves of the area integrals are implemented. To achieve this the two-fold substitution, Newtonian binomial formula, and integral expansion are applied. The derived analytical expressions allow one to examine the influence of the description and dimensions of the slot to the intensity as well as the emitted and received powers of the slot antennas. The results can be used in the investigation of the intensity amplitude distribution in array radar antennas with oval slots.","","0-7803-6428-7","10.1109/AEM.2000.943288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=943288","","Rectangular waveguides;Slot antennas;Radar antennas;Frequency;Bandwidth;Receiving antennas;Antenna arrays","","","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","29-29 June 2000","29-29 June 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method involves capturing a view of a given placement and modeling a dynamic programming problem to optimally maximize the amount of so-called useful free space as defined by a given set of parameters. The parameters act as constraints to preserve the row placement and order of the cells while minimizing the perturbation of the whole design for a successful timing and design closure. Experimental results demonstrate that by applying the proposed technique, on average, 9.7% increase in the number of inserted filler cells and 5.7% improvement in the success rate of incremental placement requests can be achieved with minimal or no impact on timing and wirelength.

Adapted from a classical max-flow algorithm for finding the (weighted) densest subgraphs, GFA first finds large (weighted) dense subgraphs in a protein-protein interaction network, and then, breaks each such subgraph into fragments iteratively by weighting its nodes appropriately in terms of their corresponding log-fold changes in the microarray data, until the fragment subgraphs are sufficiently small.

Monitoring such processes with multiple quality characteristics is challenging, especially across varying response dimensionalities. The Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MTS) is a prominent approach for such multivariate process control, yet research on its effectiveness remains fragmented. This study proposes an integrated MTS-based framework to address both low and high-dimensional response scenarios. While traditional MTS uses orthogonal array design for variable selection, hybrid MTS approaches employ metaheuristics such as Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (BWOA), and Hybrid Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (HBPSO). The proposed framework incorporates a desirability function and ANOVA analysis to evaluate monitoring performance for the appropriate selection of useful variables and threshold determination for a specific data set. Comparative analysis, using literature benchmarks and real-world manufacturing data, reveals that BPSO-based MTS generally outperforms others, with HBPSO excelling in high-dimensional contexts. Notably, the method for threshold determination in MTS shows insignificant influence on overall performance, considering all datasets. This study provides practical insights into selecting effective MTS-based monitoring strategies across varying dimensionalities.","","979-8-3315-2521-7","10.1109/IEEM63636.2025.11357799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11357799","Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS);Multivariate process control;Multiple Responses;Response Dimension;Threshold;Variable selection Method","Manufacturing processes;Input variables;Metaheuristics;Process control;Industrial engineering;Whale optimization algorithms;Manufacturing;Particle swarm optimization;Monitoring;Analysis of variance","","","","17","IEEE","2 Feb 2026","7-10 Dec. 2025","7-10 Dec. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present an analytical model that is capable of statically analyzing not only loop nest fragments, but also complete numerical programs with regular and compile-time predictable memory accesses. Central to the whole-program approach are abstract call inlining, memory access vectors, and parametric reuse analysis, which allow the reuse and interference both within and across loop nests to be quantified precisely in a unified framework. Based on the framework, the cache misses of a program are specified using mathematical formulas and the miss ratio is predicted from these formulas based on statistical sampling techniques.

The stated variations are commonly caused by uniform and non-uniform partial shading. In this paper, detailed theoretical analyses of the impact of irradiance and temperature variations caused by partial shading on PV structure have been presented. The preliminary fragment of this paper provides literature review with mathematical model. The subsequent section offers details of the simulation analysis under diverse shading conditions.

However, existing methods often face limitations in feature representation efficiency and generalization under constrained hardware setups. In this work, we propose continuous angle-of-arrival and time-of-flight maps (CATM), a novel and easily learnable feature extraction framework that jointly encodes spatial and temporal dynamics of human activities using commercial Wi-Fi devices. By integrating smoothed channel state information (CSI) with MUSIC-based signal processing, CATM constructs 2-D heatmaps that unify angle-of-arrival (AoA) and time-of-flight (ToF) features, enabling robust representation of both coarse and fine-grained movements. Unlike conventional approaches relying on fragmented temporal or spectral features, CATM inherently embeds continuous spatiotemporal patterns that simplify downstream model learning. Our lightweight Res-BiLSTM network, trained on CATM features, achieves 93.2% accuracy across eight activities and five users, under three displacement ways, and outperforms other single-domain methods. Crucially, CATM demonstrates exceptional transferability: when adapted to unseen device placements, the framework retains 80% accuracy with only 20% retraining data, significantly reducing dependence on extensive labeled datasets. These results demonstrate that CATM provides a more informative feature extraction method compared to traditional approaches relying on CSI amplitude and Doppler information for HAR.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2025.3616769","U.K. EPSRC CHEDDAR Communications Hub(grant numbers:EP/X040518/1,EP/Y037421/1,ARCOM EP/Z533609/1,EP/T021020/1,EP/T021063/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11195979","Angle of arrival;human activity recognition;transfer learning;Wi-Fi sensing","Wireless fidelity;Human activity recognition;Sensors;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Accuracy;Radar tracking;Data mining;Internet of Things;Hardware","","","","35","IEEE","7 Oct 2025","15 Nov.15, 2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ultrasound (US) insonification combined with drug-loaded poly lactic acid (PLA) microbubbles (MB) may circumvent this through targeted delivery to the tumor via increased permeability and lodging of GEM-loaded MB fragments in the tumor tissue. GEM-loaded MB were fabricated through a double emulsion process, and evaluated for efficacy as potential drug delivery agents. Acoustic and physical characterization suggest that GEM encapsulation does not significantly affect MB morphology or contrast activity (p > 0.23 compared with unmodified MB). Inertial cavitation upon exposure to US is not impacted by drug encapsulation, indicated by GEM-loaded MB exhibiting significant size reduction to fragments approximately 400 nm in diameter following insonation (p <; 0.0001). In vitro cytotoxicity of these agents confirms GEM release from the MB in response to insonation. Free GEM resulted in a complete loss of PDAC cell viability at a concentration of 62.5nM, while concentrations of 500nM and above were needed for complete PDAC cell death from GEM-loaded MB. This result is encouraging, since PLA must hydrolyze to release the encapsulated GEM. Unmodified bubbles did initiate PDAC cell death. In vivo, administration of GEM-loaded MB is well tolerated. Xenograft MiaPaCa-2 PDAC tumors were grown in 60 athymic mice (12/group). Mice were then treated with one of five therapies and monitored for tumor growth. GEM-loaded MB provide substantial tumoral imaging enhancement before and after destructive pulses.

Firstly, all images in the experimental database are unified to the same size through ROI extraction based on thinning images, and then used as input data for subsequent classifiers. Secondly, a variable-length real array is subdivided into four gene fragments to characterize the DenseNet structure. We design specific mutation and crossover operators for the evolution of DenseNet population. The optimal structure is found from a large solution space comprising 1.4 * 1019 candidates by genetic algorithm after 30 generations of evolution. Finally, the optimal DenseNet model is compared with other state-of-the-art works in detail. The proposed model achieves 98.22% accuracy on the testing set of mixed Livdet dataset. The experimental results show that genetic algorithms can automatically find the optimal structure from the solution space and further exploit the potential of DenseNet, which can help researchers to quickly construct high-performance network structures even if they are not proficient in neural networks.

We show that just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which is crucial to the runtime performance of modern interpreted languages, can introduce timing side channels in cases where the input distribution to the program is non-uniform. Such timing channels can enable an attacker to infer potentially sensitive information about predicates on the program input.We define three attack models under which such side channels are harnessable and five vulnerability templates to detect susceptible code fragments and predicates. We also propose profiling algorithms to generate the representative statistical information necessary for the attacker to perform accurate inference.We systematically evaluate the strength of these JIT-based side channels on the java.lang.String, java.lang.Math, and java.math.BigInteger classes from the Java standard library, and on the JavaScript built-in objects String, Math, and Array.

The large antenna array of the LOFAR radio telescope enables receiving very weak echo signals reflected from LEO objects. The results of the experiments confirm the feasibility of observation of the selected fragment of space and detection of the LEO objects moving in this fragment of space without knowledge of their orbital elements, which are usually given in the Two-Line Element (TLE) format.","2375-5318","979-8-3503-2920-9","10.1109/RadarConf2458775.2024.10548565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10548565","radar;passive radar;space situational awareness;SSA;orbital elements;LOFAR;radio telescope","Space vehicles;Passive radar;Radio astronomy;Spaceborne radar;Satellite broadcasting;Low earth orbit satellites;Digital communication","","14","","20","IEEE","13 Jun 2024","6-10 May 2024","6-10 May 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By employing a new approach for searching the array, our scheme can find the available submesh without the scanning of the entire 2D array unlike earlier designs. As a result, our scheme can significantly reduce the task allocation time. Comprehensive computer simulation reveals that the average allocation time and waiting delay are much smaller than earlier schemes irrespective of the size of meshes.

This short read mapping is becoming the bottle-neck of NGS systems. In this paper, we propose an FPGA system for the mapping based on a hash-index method. In our system, short reads are divided into seeds, which are fixed-length substrings used for the mapping, and the seeds are sorted using buckets. Then, the seeds in each bucket are compared in parallel with the candidate locations. With this approach, many seeds can be compared in massively parallel manner with their candidate locations, and it becomes possible to improve the processing speed by reducing the number of the random accesses to DRAM banks which store the candidate locations. Furthermore, substitutions of the nucleotides in a seed can be allowed in this parallel comparison. This makes it possible to achieve higher matching rates than previous works.","","978-1-4799-2198-0","10.1109/FPT.2013.6718385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6718385","","Genomics;Random access memory;Field programmable gate arrays;Accuracy;DNA;Indexes;Registers","","10","","6","IEEE","23 Jan 2014","9-11 Dec. 2013","9-11 Dec. 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a technique for establishing process lines, which are sets of common processes in particular problem domains, and process line architectures that incorporate commonality and variability. Process line architectures are used as a basis for deriving process lines from the perspective of overall optimization. The proposed technique includes some extensions to the Software Process Engineering Metamodel for clearly expressing the commonality and variability in the process workflows when modeling the workflows as UML activity diagrams.

The article also concentrates on OpenCL, which defines a common parallel programming language for various devices such as GPU, CPU, FPGA, etc. In order to minimize the run time of PSO, this paper introduces a new implementation of PSO in OpenCL. By decomposing the PSO code into two fragments, each one can run simultaneously. The experimental results covered both the sequential and parallel implementations.

In the present work, it is shown how the waveguide invariant can bifurcate and simultaneously have both positive and negative components. When bifurcation occurs, range-frequency mappings of acoustic intensity become fragmented.

The approach adopts the transformational programming paradigm for deriving massively parallel algorithms from functional specifications. It extends previous work by systematically generating efficient circuits and mapping them onto reconfigurable hardware. The massive parallelisation of the algorithm works by carefully composing ""off the shelf"" highly parallel implementations of each of the basic building blocks involved in the algorithm. These basic building blocks are a small collection of well-known higher order functions such as map, fold, and zipwith. By using function decomposition and data refinement techniques, these powerful functions are refined into highly parallel implementations described in Hoare's CSP. The CSP descriptions are very closely associated with Handle-C program fragments. Handle-C is a programming language based on C and extended by parallelism and communication primitives taken from CSP. In the final stage the circuit description is generated by compiling Handle-C programs and then mapped onto the targeted reconfigurable hardware such as the RC-1000 FPGA system from Celoxica. This approach is illustrated by a case study involving the generation of several versions of the matrix multiplication algorithm.","","0-7803-7983-7","10.1109/AICCSA.2003.1227451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227451","","Hardware;Circuits;Field programmable gate arrays;Functional programming;Parallel programming;Parallel algorithms;Computer languages;Reconfigurable architectures","","1","","","IEEE","8 Sep 2003","14-18 July 2003","14-18 July 2003","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SMT allows problem formulation in richer first-order logic fragments. The detailed routing constraints are directly mapped to a chain of the standard SMT-LIB2 assertions of equality and inequality predicates. The SMT formulation eliminates the need to encode the net track segments into Boolean variables and to decode the routing solution. Moreover, it is independent of the channel width. Using SMT assertion stack capabilities, the detailed routing problem can be explored for various FPGA architecture models with different routing resources capabilities without the need to reformulate the whole constraints. SMT capability for solving objective functions is utilized to find the optimal minimum channel width. Experimental results show that the proposed SMT-based approach provides higher modeling flexibility and execution speedup compared to the SAT-based approach.","","978-1-5090-0246-7","10.1109/ICECS.2015.7440391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440391","Detailed routing;Boolean Satisfiability;SMT;SMT-LIB2;Objective function","Routing;Field programmable gate arrays;Switches;Mathematical model;Linear programming;Standards;Pins","","1","1","14","IEEE","24 Mar 2016","6-9 Dec. 2015","6-9 Dec. 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The genetic variation was mainly maintained within populations, but there was still obvious differentiation among populations. AMOVA analysis revealed that the genetic diversity of PMA was significantly higher than that for PHA (P<;0.01), and the genetic diversity of PMA (PLA) was nearly significantly higher than that for PLA (PHA) (P<;0.10).

In this research, we developed a software prototype for correcting DNA sequencing error. We employed the spectral alignment technique implemented as a pre-processing step before the DNA sequence assembly process. We tested our method by using simulated DNA reads containing errors.

This review explores developments from 2020 to 2025 in hardware-software co-design (HW/SW co-design) strategies, which enable integration between hardware accelerators and software components. The paper systematically categorizes codesign approaches based on ML methodologies, target platforms, and application domains, highlighting key performance metrics such as throughput, energy efficiency, latency, and accuracy. Through an in-depth analysis of frameworks like RSNN, TinyM2Net-V2, and CODEBench, and toolchains such as Vivado HLS, TVM, and TensorFlow Lite, the review showcases their application in edge AI, computer vision, scientific computing, and secure processing. Quantitative comparisons reveal that FPGA-based designs achieve an optimal balance between performance and power efficiency, outperforming GPUs and ASICs in several energy-constrained scenarios. Challenges such as partitioning complexity, fragmented toolchains, and limited automation are discussed alongside trends in dynamic partial reconfiguration, AI-driven toolchains, and RISC-V-based SoCs. Future research directions emphasize the need for unified frameworks, support for complex models and hardware-aware optimization techniques.

Traditional Doppler shift estimators including the cyclic prefix (CP) based estimator (CPBE), the two-training-symbol based estimator (TBE) and the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) have inferior estimation accuracy especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose the new Doppler shift estimator for mmWave communication systems on HSRs: an equally-divided structure based estimator (ESBE) that divides the effective orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol into multiple equal fragments. Simulation results show that our new estimator outperforms several existing Doppler shift estimators in mmWave communication systems on HSR.","2377-8644","978-1-5386-7005-7","10.1109/ICCChina.2018.8641224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8641224","Beamforming;Doppler shift;high-speed railway (HSR);maximum likelihood (ML);millimeter-wave (mmWave)","Doppler shift;Antennas;OFDM;Training;Estimation;Wireless communication","","4","","11","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","16-18 Aug. 2018","16-18 Aug. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main request for the detection method is the reliability of finding cracks formed in the concrete, which is expected to breach before the reinforcement material such steel, plastic, or glass. This breach occurs due to significantly lower concrete tensile strength in comparison with the concrete compressive strength. This negative feature is eliminated by using tensile reinforcement to capture those tensile forces. The cracks do not always mean the reduction of bearing capacity of the structure as a whole; however, they indicate an exceeding of allowable stress for which the structure was designed. Great risk in terms of protection of persons inside the protective structure represents a degree of distortion of the structure in which there is a loss of an under-pressure function or a formation of secondary fragments.","","978-1-5090-5666-8","10.1109/MILTECHS.2017.7988758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7988758","numerical analysis;field tests;non-destructive testing;georadar;ultrasound","Ultrasonic imaging;Concrete;Probes;Surface waves;Testing;Surface cracks;Bars","","2","","28","IEEE","24 Jul 2017","31 May-2 June 2017","31 May-2 June 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the aerial coverage is fragmented, trajectory planning for UAVs while maintaining basic connectivity becomes challenging. In this work, we propose a trajectory planning algorithm that uses the weighted sum method to measure and compare the paths based on the distance, coverage conditions, and adaptable network requirements. We further analyze the impact of movements a UAV can make in 3D grid for pathfinding. A UAV can move in different directions at variable distances. Our results show that a higher degree of movement allows the algorithm to find shorter paths than the lower degree of movement.

Real-Time Logic (RTL) has been used to describe the specification and safety asser- tion of real-time systems. However, the satisfiability prob- lem for RTL, as well as other first-order logics, is unde- cidable. There exist already non-trivial fragments of RTL, like path RTL and extended path RTL, for which the veri- fication can be done efficiently. The key idea used by these RTL fragments was the so-called constraint graph. The con- straint graph can express dependencies between two events, but cannot describe dependencies between three or more events. This paper presents a larger class than existing frag- ments of RTL for which the verification problem can also be solved efficiently. Our new class is called Linear Real- Time Logic (LRTL) and includes the existing decidable RTL fragments like path RTL and extended path RTL. The LRTL class is able to express any linear timing constraint with an arbitrary number of events variables (e.g., between three or more events). The main ingredient of the LRTL class is the use of matrices instead of the constraint graph, as a more powerful data structure capable of performing the conver- sion from RTL to a propositional formula. The unsatisfi- ability of the propositional formula will ensure the safety and feasibility of the given real-time system. Experimental results show that the execution times for LRTL are better than the systems expressed in extended path RTL, and com- parable with those expressed in path RTL.","1052-8725","978-0-7695-3062-8","10.1109/RTSS.2007.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4408317","","Logic;Real time systems;Safety;Timing;Computer science;Embedded system;Phased arrays;Formal specifications;Data structures;Radar","","3","","23","IEEE","26 Dec 2007","3-6 Dec. 2007","3-6 Dec. 2007","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The stable driving range is extended to 50% of the initial air gap with ~90% increase in the pull-in voltage. Mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical analytical models are developed. These models are validated through microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) simulations using CoventorMP and transistor simulations in Synopsys TCAD.

However there has not been much progress in worst case timing analysis of data caching. This is mainly due to load/store instructions that reference multiple memory locations such as those used to implement array and pointer based references. These load/store instructions are called dynamic load/store instructions and most current analysis techniques take a very conservative approach to their timing analysis. In many cases, it is assumed that each of the references from a dynamic load/store instruction will miss in the cache and replace a cache block that would otherwise lead to a cache hit. This conservative approach results in severe overestimation of the worst case execution time (WCET). The paper proposes two techniques to minimize the WCET overestimation due to such load/store instructions. The first technique uses a global data flow analysis technique to reduce the number of load/store instructions that are misclassified as dynamic load/store instructions. The second technique utilizes data dependence analysis to minimize the adverse impact of dynamic load/store instructions. The paper also compares the WCET bounds of simple benchmark programs that are predicted with and without applying the proposed techniques. The results show that they significantly (up to 20%) improve the accuracy of WCET estimation especially for programs with a large number of references from dynamic load/store instructions.","","0-8186-7448-2","10.1109/RTTAS.1996.509540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=509540","","Computer aided software engineering;Timing;Data analysis;Reduced instruction set computing;Real time systems;Computer aided instruction;Scheduling algorithm;Processor scheduling;Computer languages;Dynamic programming","","33","1","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","10-12 June 1996","10-12 June 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, only a small part of them is widely used. Widely-used methods are line-based and token-based ones. They have high scalability because they neither require deep source code analysis nor constructing complex intermediate structures for the detection. High scalability is one of the big advantages in code clone detection tools. On the other hand, line/token-based detections yield many false positives. One of the factors is the presence of repeated instructions in the source code. For example, herein we assume that there are consecutive three printf statements in C source code. If we apply a token-based detection to them, the former two statements are detected as a code clone of the latter two statements. However, such overlapped code clones are redundant and so not useful for developers. In this paper, we propose a new detection method that is free from the influence of the presence of repeated instructions. The proposed method transforms every of repeated instructions into a special form, and then it detects code clones using a suffix array algorithm. The transformation prevents many false positives from being detected. Also, the detection speed remains. The proposed detection method has already been developed as a software tool, FRISC. We confirmed the usefulness of the proposed method by conducting a quantitative evaluation of FRISC with Bellon's oracle.","","978-0-7695-4783-1","10.1109/SCAM.2012.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392103","Code clone detection;False positive reduction;Tool comparison","Cloning;Indexes;Java;Scalability;Software tools;Humans","","16","","23","IEEE","24 Dec 2012","23-24 Sept. 2012","23-24 Sept. 2012","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A custom-designed 1.1-/2.2-MHz two-element confocal-annular array was used to treat approximately 6-mm tumors under ultrasound guidance and real-time monitoring. Two-stage millisecond-length ultrasound pulses were used to generate approximate cuboid ablation volumes (diagonal 5–6 mm) within each tumor, with a dose of 100 pulses/point. Immune effects were characterized by changes of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and infiltration levels of immune cells. In all targeted treatment areas, bubble cloud activity was visualized by ultrasound monitoring. The novel protocol resulted in elliptical and controllable sized lesions, reducing the number of scanning points, and was generally well tolerated. After treatment, tumor growth experienced a seven-day stagnation period, the survival period of mice was prolonged, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell infiltration increased.

Therefore, code clones such as repetitions and duplications with similar structures are often included. In this study, we propose a Type-2 code clone detection technique for deriving patterns within Dockerfiles. More specifically, our technique detects code clones by normalizing tokens properly, separating Docker syntax and shell syntax, and then adopting suﬃx array algorithm for each syntax.

The file systems are designed to provide high bandwidth between disks and main memory by taking advantage of parallelism in an underlying disk array catering to large units of transfer, and minimizing the bandwidth dedicated to the transfer of metadata. All of the file systems described use a multiblock allocation strategy which allows both large and small files to be allocated efficiently. Simulation results show that these multiblock policies result in systems that are able to utilize a large percentage of the underlying disk bandwidth (more than 90% in sequential cases). As general-purpose systems are called upon to support more data intensive applications such as databases and supercomputing, these policies offer an opportunity to provide superior performance to a larger class of users.<>","","0-8186-2138-9","10.1109/ICDE.1991.131509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=131509","","Design optimization;File systems;Databases;Bandwidth;Parallel processing;Computational modeling;Time sharing computer systems;Operating systems;Utility programs","","3","3","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","8-12 April 1991","8-12 April 1991","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Next we propose a distribution analysis algorithm which can automatically summarize the distribution pattern of pointer-based distributed objects built by application programmers. Our work, to our best knowledge, is the first work to attempt to address this open issue. Our distribution analysis framework employs Feautrier's parametric integer programming as the basic solver, and can always obtain precise distribution information from the class of programs written in our parallel programming model with static control.

These maps will enable researchers to locate, characterize, and eventually understand the genes that control human structure and function. The volume and complexity of the data already generated requires a sophisticated array of computational support to collect, store, analyze, integrate and display data in biologically meaningful ways. The Human Genome Center at Livermore has spent the past 6 years constructing a database system to support its physical mapping efforts on human chromosome 19. Our computational support team is composed of experienced computer professionals who share a common pragmatic primary goal of rapidly supplying tools that meet the ever-changing needs of the biologists. In this paper, we concentrate on the design issues, tradeoffs, and consequences from the point of view of building a complex database system to support leading-edge genomic research. We introduce the topic of physical mapping, discuss the key design issues involved in our database, and discuss the use of this data by our major tools (DNA fingerprint analysis and overlap computation, contig assembly, map integration and database browsing). Given the advantage of hindsight, we discuss what worked, what didn't, and where to go from here. As early pioneers in this field, we hope that our experience may prove useful to others who are now beginning to design and construct similar systems.<>","","0-8186-6930-6","10.1109/HICSS.1995.375355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=375355","","Database systems;Humans;Biology computing;Biological cells;Computer displays;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Chromosome mapping;Buildings;DNA","","1","","12","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","3-6 Jan. 1995","3-6 Jan. 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As semiconductor technology revolutionized computing, modern DNA sequencing technology (termed Next Generation Sequencing, NGS) revolutionized genomic research. As a result, modern NGS platforms can sequence hundreds of millions of short DNA fragments in parallel. The sequenced DNA fragments, representing the output of NGS platforms, are termed reads. Besides genomic variations, NGS imperfections induce noise in reads. Mapping each read to (the most similar portion of) a reference genome of the same species, i.e., read mapping, is a common critical first step in a diverse set of emerging bioinformatics applications. Mapping represents a search-heavy memory-intensive similarity matching problem, therefore, can greatly benefit from near-memory processing. Intuition suggests using fast associative search enabled by Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) by construction. However, the excessive energy consumption and lack of support for similarity matching (under NGS and genomic variation induced noise) renders direct application of TCAM infeasible, irrespective of volatility, where only non-volatile TCAM can accommodate the large memory footprint in an area-efficient way. This paper introduces GeNVoM, a scalable, energy-efficient and high-throughput solution. Instead of optimizing an algorithm developed for general-purpose computers or GPUs, GeNVoM rethinks the algorithm and non-volatile TCAM-based accelerator design together from the ground up. Thereby GeNVoM can improve the throughput by up to 3.67×; the energy consumption, by up to 1.36×, when compared to an ASIC baseline, which represents one of the highest-throughput implementations known.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2021.3118018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9560023","Hardware accelerator;in-memory computing;content-addressable memory;bioinformatics;read mapping accelerator;DNA sequencing in memory","Bioinformatics;Genomics;DNA;Sequential analysis;Nonvolatile memory;Throughput;Field programmable gate arrays","Software;Algorithms;Genomics;Computers;Sequence Analysis, DNA;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;DNA","15","","70","IEEE","6 Oct 2021","1 Nov.-Dec. 2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This technology can now produce billions of short DNA fragments (reads) in a single run. One of the most demanding computational problems used by almost every sequencing pipeline is short-read alignment; i.e. determining where each fragment originated from in the original genome. Most current solutions are based on a seed-and-extend approach, where promising candidate regions (seeds) are first identified and subsequently extended in order to verify whether a full high-scoring alignment actually exists in the vicinity of each seed. Seed verification is the main bottleneck in many state-of-the-art aligners and thus finding fast solutions is of high importance. We present a parallel un gapped-alignment-featured seed verification (PUNAS) algorithm, a fast filter for effectively removing the majority of false positive seeds, thus significantly accelerating the short-read alignment process. PUNAS is based on bit-parallelism and takes advantage of SIMD vector units of modern microprocessors. Our implementation employs a vectorize-and-scale approach supporting multi-core CPUs and many-core Knights Landing (KNL)-based Xeon Phi processors. Performance evaluation reveals that PUNAS is over three orders-of-magnitude faster than seed verification with the Smith-Waterman algorithm and around one order-of-magnitude faster than seed verification with the banded version of Myers bit-vector algorithm. Using a single thread it achieves a speedup of up to 7.3, 27.1, and 11.6 compared to the shifted Hamming distance filter on a SSE, AVX2, and AVX-512 based CPU/KNL, respectively. The speed of our framework further scales almost linearly with the number of cores.

This paper presents a method of reducing this computational cost with the use of a reconfigurable computing architecture. Colour histogram data of moving targets are used to generate binary signatures for the detection of merged or fragmented objects. The main contribution in this paper is how binary histogram data is generated and used to detect split/merge object with the use of logical operations native to the hardware architecture used for its implementation.

Facing the new requests of constructing Golden Course and based on the analysis of the relationship between Golden Course and Attention Deficit Disorder, the paper takes the national-level MOOC, Data structure, as an example and explores three approaches to solve the problem of Attention Deficit Disorder from the perspective of teaching content organization and implementation. These three approaches are also the core strategies for Golden Course design. The main content is as follows. First, establish the levels of learning objectives under the guidance of BLOOM model, and optimize the design of learning objectives with Mager method, so that students can obtain specific information, find correct learning direction, and avoid lack of attention. Second, use concept map to select and divide learning content, highlighting the importance and relevance of learning content, and ensure that the content is explained within about 10 minutes. Although the time is fragmented, the content is not fragmented. Third, the BOPPPS model is used to organize the process of course implementation and introduce the learning content under the guidance of questions, so as to ensure that the internal logic of the course is compact and effective, and students' interest in learning can be enhanced. Practice shows that the curriculum design strategy which combines the three approaches mentioned above can effectively solve the problem of Attention Deficit Disorder. The course, Data Structure, constructed with three mentioned approaches, was selected as one of the national-level MOOCs in January 2019, which has been running for 4 years on the net for 7 semesters, with a course rating score of 4.8 points out of 5 points, and taken by more than 70,000 learners.","","978-1-7281-7008-4","10.1109/CSEI50228.2020.9142523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142523","Golden Course;Curriculum Design;BOPPPS;Bloom Taxonomy;Concept Map;Data Structure;Attention Deficit Disorder","Education;Programmable logic arrays;Data structures;Standards;Technological innovation;Organizations;Merging","","1","","12","IEEE","17 Jul 2020","12-14 June 2020","12-14 June 2020","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The APs can prefetch and store the files requested by users, to serve users directly in the access links. Thus low-latency transmissions are enabled as the transmission in the backhaul links is saved. However, due to the limited cache capacity, not all requested files can be stored in the APs, some of the non-cached APs then should be utilized as long as their transmission delays in the access and backhaul links can be well addressed. Two delay optimal beamformer design (DOBD) problems are formulated to minimize the overall delay incurred in the backhaul and access link transmissions via a joint optimization of the beamformer at the BS and APs. We consider the DOBD problem under non-fragment and fragment caching policies, both involving nonconvex link rate constraints. The semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and sequential convex approximation (SCA) schemes are adopted to approximate the nonconvex problems into convex ones, which are then iteratively solved. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence and improved transmission delay performance of the proposed scheme under various network settings.","2509-3312","","10.23919/JCIN.2023.10173730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173730","joint beamforming;backhaul and access links;delay optimal;cache-enabled network","Backhaul networks;Wireless communication;Array signal processing;Delays;Wireless sensor networks;Optimization;Communication system security","","1","","","","5 Jul 2023","June 2023","","PTP","PTP Journals"

For a distributed database to be at optimal performance and thus provide an efficient service it needs to be designed appropriately. The significance of the perfect design is only emphasized by the multiple dimensions required in generating a design. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an approach to generate optimal designs for such distributed database systems and to develop a prototype to demonstrate the said approach. The approach emphasizes on the accuracy of inputs as it largely determines the quality of the final solution. Hence the extraction of network information, a key dimension, is automated to ensure precision. The global schema is fragmented considering data requirements as well as connectivity of each site. Allocation of fragments is treated as a combinatorial optimization problem and assigned to a memetic algorithm. An estimation of distribution algorithm complements the search effort of this memetic algorithm. Site options for replication server environments are investigated based on a shortest path algorithm. Usability of the system in an object oriented development environment, through conditional object-relational mapping, is also explored. The prototype was developed using an evolutionary prototyping approach. It was evaluated by several experts in the relevant fields of application. The results of which, confirmed the practicality of the suggested approach.","2151-1810","1-4244-0554-8","10.1109/ICINFA.2006.374142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4250232","Distributed Database Design;Memetic Agorithms;Object-Relational Mapping;Bandwidth Measurement","Distributed databases;Database systems;Prototypes;Globalization;Data mining;Relational databases;Spatial databases;Distributed computing;Physics computing;Informatics","","","","14","IEEE","25 Jun 2007","15-17 Dec. 2006","15-17 Dec. 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Effective information retrieval using genetic algorithms based matching functions adaptation","P. Pathak; M. Gordon; Weiguo Fan","Purdue University, USA; University of Michigan, USA; University of Michigan, USA",Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,"6 Aug 2002","2000","","","8 pp. vol.1","","Knowledge intensive organizations have vast array of information contained in large document repositories. With the advent of E-commerce and corporate intranets/extranets, these repositories are expected to grow at a fast pace. This explosive growth has led to huge, fragmented, and unstructured document collections. Although it has become easier to collect and store information in document collections, it has become increasingly difficult to retrieve relevant information from these large document collections. This paper addresses the issue of improving retrieval performance (in terms of precision and recall) for retrieval from document collections. There are three important paradigms of research in the area of information retrieval (1R): Probabilistic IR, Knowledge-based IR, and, Artificial Intelligence based techniques like neural networks and symbolic learning. Very few researcher have tried to use evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms (GAs). Previous attempts at using GAs have concentrated on modifying document representations or modifying query representations. This work looks at the possibility of applying GAs to adapt various matching functions. It is hoped that such an adaptation of the matching functions in lead to a better retrieval performance than that obtained by using a single matching function. An overall matching function is treated as an weighted combination of scores produced by individual matching functions. This overall score is asked to rank and retrieve documents. Weights associated with individual functions are searched using Genetic Algorithms. The idea is tested on a real document collection called the Cranfield collection. The results look very encouraging.","","0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926653","","Information retrieval;Genetic algorithms;Testing;Extranets;Adaptive arrays;Electronic switching systems;Read only memory;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Costs","","48","11","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","7-7 Jan. 2000","7-7 Jan. 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

FELIX will function as a router between custom serial links from front-end application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to data collection and processing components via a commodity switched network. Links may aggregate many slower links or be a single high-bandwidth link. FELIX will also forward the LHC bunch-crossing clock, fixed latency trigger accepts and resets received from the TTC system to front-end electronics. The FELIX system uses commodity server technology in combination with FPGA-based Peripheral Component Interconnect express I/O cards. The FELIX host servers will run a software routing platform serving data to network clients. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers connected to FELIX systems via the same network will run the new Software Readout Driver (SW ROD) infrastructure for event fragment building and buffering, with support for detector or trigger specific data processing, and will serve the data upon request to the ATLAS High-Level Trigger for Event Building and Selection.

However, sketches are sensitive to hash collisions due to skewed keys in real world environment, and need complicated performance control for line-rate packet streams.We present Jellyfish, a locality-sensitive sketching framework to address these issues. Jellyfish goes beyond network flow-based sketching towards fragments of network flows called subflows. First, Jellyfish splits consecutive packets from each network flow to subflow records, which not only reduces the rate contention but also provides intermediate subflow representations in form of truncated counters. Next, Jellyfish maps similar subflow records to the same bucket array and merges those from the same network flow to reconstruct the network-flow level counters. Real-world trace-driven experiments show that Jellyfish reduces the average estimation errors by up to six orders of magnitude for per-flow queries, by six orders of magnitude for entropy queries, and up to ten times for heavy-hitter queries.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488847","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488847","subflow;sketch;hash collision;clustering;heavy hitter","Estimation error;Scalability;Conferences;Computational modeling;Entropy;Arrays","","2","","38","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","10-13 May 2021","10-13 May 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the essential algorithm behind the succeeding NGS data analysis, DNA mapping, is still excessively time consuming. DNA mapping can be partitioned into two parts: suffix array (SA) sorting and backward searching. Dedicated hardware designs for the less-complex backward searching have been proposed, but feasible hardware for the most complicated part, SA sorting, has never been explored. Based on the memory-efficient sBWT algorithm, this work is the first integrated NGS data processor for the entire DNA mapping. The k-ordered Ferragina and Manzini index used in the sBWT algorithm is leveraged to improve storage capacity and reduce hardware complexity. The proposed NGS data processor realizes the sBWT algorithm through bucket sorting, suffix grouping, and suffix sorting circuits. Key design parameters are analyzed to achieve the optimal performance with respect to hardware cost and execution time. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, the NGS data processor dissipates 135 mW at 200 MHz from a 0.9-V supply. With 1-GB external memory, the chip can analyze human DNA within 10 min.

These distributed data readout topologies rely on an accurate time information available at the front end, where the raw data are acquired and tagged with a precise timestamp prior to data buffering and central data collecting. This makes the network complexity and latency, between front-end and backend electronics, negligible within upper bounds imposed by the front-end data buffer capability where the raw data are stored waiting for the trigger validation. The proposed research work describes a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) that exploits the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) timing, trigger, and control (TTC) system as a multicast messaging physical and data link layer. The hardware implementation extends the clock synchronization to the nanoseconds range, overcoming the typical accuracy limitations inferred by computers Ethernet-based local area network (LAN). Establishing a reliable communication between master and timing receiver nodes is essential in a message-based synchronization system. In the backend electronics, the serial data streams synchronization with the global clock domain is guaranteed by a hardware-based finite state machine that scans the bit period using a variable delay chain and finds the optimal sampling point. The validity of the proposed timing system has been proven in point-to-point data links as well as in star topology configurations over standard CAT-5e cables. The results achieved together with weaknesses and possible improvements are hereby detailed.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2019.2906045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669820","Eye diagram;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);front-end electronics;hardware;synchronization;timing system","Synchronization;Clocks;Delays;Physics;Protocols;Ethernet","","22","","12","IEEE","19 Mar 2019","July 2019","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Intrusive techniques often result in code changes that are not easily reversible, and can negatively impact readability, maintainability, and performance on different architectures. We introduce an extensible annotation-based empirical tuning system called Orio that is aimed at improving both performance and productivity. It allows software developers to insert annotations in the form of structured comments into their source code to trigger a number of low-level performance optimizations on a specified code fragment. To maximize the performance tuning opportunities, the annotation processing infrastructure is designed to support both architecture-independent and architecture-specific code optimizations. Given the annotated code as input, Orio generates many tuned versions of the same operation and empirically evaluates the alternatives to select the best performing version for production use. We have also enabled the use of the Pluto automatic parallelization tool in conjunction with Orio to generate efficient OpenMP-based parallel code.

To aid with determining which embedded platform is most suitable for their application, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of the run-time performance and energy efficiency of a wide range of vision kernels. We discuss rationales for why a given underlying hardware architecture innately performs well or poorly based on the characteristics of a range of vision kernel categories. Specifically, our study is performed for three commonly used HW accelerators for embedded vision applications: ARM57 CPU, Jetson TX2 GPU and ZCU102 FPGA, using their vendor optimized vision libraries: OpenCV, VisionWorks and xfOpenCV. Our results show that the GPU achieves an energy/frame reduction ratio of 1.1-3.2× compared to the others for simple kernels. While for more complicated kernels and complete vision pipelines, the FPGA outperforms the others with energy/frame reduction ratios of 1.2-22.3×. It is also observed that the FPGA performs increasingly better as a vision application's pipeline complexity grows.","","978-1-7281-2437-7","10.1109/ICESS.2019.8782524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8782524","Embedded Vision;GPUs;FPGAs;CPUs;Energy Efficiency","Kernel;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Graphics processing units;Libraries;Benchmark testing;Computer architecture","","158","","17","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","2-3 June 2019","2-3 June 2019","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel virtual computing resource allocation (VCRA) method which can dynamically split the users workload into smaller fragments to be served by virtual machines is presented. Under the proposed scheme, we aim at maximizing the network energy efficiency by a joint design of virtual computing resources, transmit beamforming, remote radio head (RRH) selection, and RRH-user association. Moreover, we construct a more realistic fronthaul power consumption model, which is directly proportional to users' rate transmitted by the corresponding RRHs. The formulated problem is combinatorial and difficult to solve in general. Our first contribution is to customize a branch-and-reduce-and-bound method to attain a globally optimal solution. To compute a high-quality approximate solution, a standard routine is used to deal with the continuous relaxation of the original problem. However, the proposed continuous relaxation is non-convex which implies another challenge. For a practically appealing solution approach, we resort to a local optimization method, namely the difference of convex algorithm. Our second contribution is on the use of Lipschitz continuity to arrive at a sequence of convex quadratic programs, which can be solved efficiently by modern convex solvers. Finally, a post-processing procedure is proposed to obtain a high-performance feasible solution from the continuous relaxation. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms converge rapidly and achieve near-optimal performance as well as outperform other known methods. Moreover, we numerically show that the VCRA scheme significantly improves the system energy efficiency compared to the existing schemes.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2018.2799859","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada NSERC(grant numbers:318,000$ CAD over three years); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:318,000$ CAD over three years); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8279466","Beamforming;cloud radio access networks;computational provisioning;limited fronthaul;optimization;virtualization;network slicing","Resource management;Power demand;Cloud computing;Optimization;Array signal processing;Virtualization;Approximation algorithms","","35","","44","IEEE","2 Feb 2018","April 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the merits of the constant-modulus nature of the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence and the cyclic prefix (CP) structure of the physical random access channel (PRACH) frame, the device RFF integrated in both the frequency-domain ZC sequence and the transient ramp-on/ramp-off sequences are extracted. For the frequency-domain RFF extraction, the cepstrum of the ZC sequence is calculated to enlarge the gap between the constant RFF and the random fading effects, and the correlation between two cepstrum fragments is then calculated to mitigate the random fading components. For the temporal RFF extraction, the ramp-on and ramp-off features induced by the device-specific power amplifier are extracted by exploiting the CP structure of the PRACH frame, where the CP part and the duplicate part are adaptively filtered and the final adapted weight of the least mean square filter is used as RFF. No prior PRACH parameter knowledge is required in RFF extraction and both the frequency-domain and the temporal RFF are combined as the input of the convolutional neural network to enhance the classification accuracy. With four-months sampling of PRACH signals emitted from universal software radio peripheral devices, the experimental results show that the authentication accuracy of the proposed combined RFF can reach as high as 99.9% in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenario and 99.6% in the non-LOS scenario.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2023.3277036","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071250,62222107,62071223,62031012); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3904404); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242022R40030); Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:20KJB510033); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128727","Physical-layer security;radio frequency fingerprints;impersonation attack;long term evolution","Long Term Evolution;Feature extraction;Authentication;Programmable logic arrays;Frequency-domain analysis;Cepstrum;Fading channels","","18","","28","IEEE","17 May 2023","Oct. 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main contributions of our work are a fragmentation metric able to estimate when the FPGA fragmentation status has become critical, and several heuristics to decide when to perform defragmentation and how to perform it. This defragmentation heuristics can be of a preventive kind, driven by alarms that fire when isolated islands appear or a high fragmentation status is reached. It can be also an on-demand process produced when a task allocation fails though there is enough free area in the FPGA to accommodate it.","1530-2075","1-4244-0054-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639432","","Hardware;Multitasking;Field programmable gate arrays;Resource management;Runtime;Fires;Time factors;Multiprocessor interconnection networks","","7","","19","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","25-29 April 2006","25-29 April 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key problem in this research domain is the assembly of DNA sequences obtained from sequencing machines. Next Generation DNA Sequencing (NGS) technologies generate a large number of short fragments (sequences) of fixed length known as reads, which are a part of the genome sequence being assembled. It is computationally very time consuming to assemble these short reads to form the genome sequence purely with software. FPGAs have been effectively used to build accelerators to speed up the computation process. In this paper, we propose HEBs to accelerate the genome assembly process.

Users typically prefer to checkpoint into a shared file yet parallel file systems often perform poorly for shared file writing. A powerful technique to address this problem is to transparently transform shared file writing into many exclusively written as is done in ADIOS and PLFS. Unfortunately, the metadata to reconstruct the fragments into the original file grows with the number of writers. As such, the current approach cannot scale to exaflop supercomputers due to the large overhead of creating and reassembling the metadata. In this paper, we develop and evaluate algorithms by which patterns in the PLFS metadata can be discovered and then used to replace the current metadata. Our evaluation shows that these patterns reduce the size of the metadata by several orders of magnitude, increase the performance of writes by up to 40 percent, and the performance of reads by up to 480 percent. This contribution therefore can allow current checkpointing models to survive the transition from peta- to exascale.","","978-0-7695-4956-9","10.1109/SC.Companion.2012.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6495793","pattern;structure;I/O;metadata;parallel file system;PLFS","Indexes;Writing;Metadata;Arrays;Supercomputers;Checkpointing;Transforms;Periodic structures;Memory management;File systems","","6","","26","IEEE","11 Apr 2013","10-16 Nov. 2012","10-16 Nov. 2012","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.","","978-1-4577-1454-2","10.1109/ANCS.2011.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710","String Matching;Packet Reordering;Network Security","Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Automata;Arrays;Complexity theory;Security","","6","","12","IEEE","31 Oct 2011","3-4 Oct. 2011","3-4 Oct. 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although there are many programming models and languages de-signed for programming accelerators, such as CUDA, AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing (AMD APP), and OpenCL, these models remain difficult and complex. Furthermore, when programming for accelerator-enhanced clusters, we have to use an inter-node programming interface, such as MPI to coordinate the nodes. In order to address these problems and reduce complexity, an extension to XcalableMP (XMP), a PGAS language, for use on accelerator-enhanced clusters, called XcalableMP Device Acceleration Extension (XMP-dev), is proposed. In XMP-dev, a global distributed data is mapped onto distributed memory of each accelerator, and a fragment of codes can be of-floaded to execute in a set of accelerators. It eliminates the complex programming between nodes and accelerators and between nodes. In this paper, we present an implementation of the XMP-dev runtime library with the OpenCL APIs, while the previous implementation targets CUDA-only. Since OpenCL is a standardized interface supported for various kinds of accelerators, it improves the portability of XMP-dev and reduces the cost of development. In the result of performance evaluation, we show that the OpenCL implementation of XMP-dev can generate portable programs that can run on not only NVIDIA GPU-enhanced clusters but also various accelerator-enhanced clusters.","","978-1-4673-0974-5","10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6270611","Cluster;Accelerator;OpenCL","Graphics processing unit;Acceleration;Kernel;Programming;Synchronization;Arrays","","5","","20","IEEE","20 Aug 2012","21-25 May 2012","21-25 May 2012","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we devise an iterative algorithm called “VNE-B”. Typical VN embedding algorithms may cause fragmentations of the substrate network, i.e. the substrate resources are fragmented into small isolated pieces, making it unable to meet larger future VN requests. VNE-B starts the mapping from the “border” nodes of both VNs and the SN for reducing fragmentation of SN resources.

With the increasing requirement of reliability in storage systems and fast development of cloud computing, RAID-6, which can tolerate concurrent failures of any two disks, receives more attention than ever. However, the write performance of RAID-6 systems is a bottleneck to serve various applications. In the last two decades, many approaches are proposed to enhance the write performance of RAID-6, but they have several limitations, such as unbalanced I/O distribution and high I/O cost. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Balanced Partial Stripe (BPS) write scheme to improve the write performance of RAID-6 systems. The basic idea of BPS is reorganizing the distribution of write data blocks according to a global point of view on modified parities, and flushing these blocks to storage devices at once. Therefore, it can significantly reduce the total number of parity updates and balance the I/O workload. BPS has three main advantages: 1) BPS decreases the number of I/O operations and aggregate the fragmented I/Os, which improves the I/O performance, 2) BPS provides a balanced partial stripe write approach for RAID-6, 3) BPS can be applied with various erasure codes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme, we conduct simulations on DiskSim to evaluate different partial stripe write approaches. The results show that, compared to typical partial stripe write approaches, BPS reduces the average access time by up to 37.14%, and decreases the number of write operations by up to 26.24%.","2168-9253","978-1-4673-6598-7","10.1109/CLUSTER.2015.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307586","RAID-6;MDS Codes;Performance Evaluation;Load Balancing;Partial Stripe Writet","Layout;Arrays;Reliability;Optimization;Aggregates;Computer science;Cloud computing","","3","","40","IEEE","29 Oct 2015","8-11 Sept. 2015","8-11 Sept. 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The formulated problem is generally combinatorial and NP-hard. For an appealing solution approach, we resort to the difference of convex algorithm (DCA) to solve the continuous relaxed problem. In particular, Lipschitz continuity is derived for non-convex parts to arrive at a sequence of convex quadratic programs, which can be solved efficiently by modern convex solvers. Finally, a post-processing procedure is proposed to obtain a high-performance feasible solution from the continuous relaxation.

Using multiple CPUs is one way to reduce route time. However, exploiting parallelism on the most performant algorithms incorporating negotiated congestion, directed searches, and incremental approaches has been challenging. We introduce two parallel routers extending the state-of-the-art PathFinder-based AIR router in VPR 8. The first is the baseline parallel router, based on the widely applied technique of recursively bi-partitioning the physical FPGA so nonoverlapping nets can be routed in parallel; however, scalability is limited by nets (often high-fanout) spanning large chip areas. The second router enhances the baseline by applying a new net decomposition method to enable fragments of nets to be routed in parallel for better scalability. For intra-cluster routing, Titan benchmarks, and eight threads, we obtain a speedup of $2.14 \times$ with the baseline and $2.38 \times$ with the net-decomposing router, compared to the latest VPR 8+ sequential router. On flat (singlestep) routing, the net-decomposing router achieves a speedup of $2.15 \times$ with eight threads. The routers are deterministic and serially equivalent, achieving wire length and critical path delay comparable to the sequential algorithm. The routers are being integrated into the open-source VTR framework, enabling the research community to build on this work.","2837-0449","979-8-3315-2321-3","10.1109/ICFPT64416.2024.11113423","Swiss National Science Foundation(grant numbers:218864); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11113423","","Scalability;Parallel processing;Benchmark testing;Routing;Delays;Wire;Field programmable gate arrays;Video recording","","1","","27","IEEE","18 Aug 2025","10-12 Dec. 2024","10-12 Dec. 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the rapid development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, faster short read mapping is required. In this paper, we propose a variable length hash method to further accelerate FPGA short read mapping systems. In the hash-based short read mapping algorithms, a fixed length sub-string of each short read, called seed, is used as the key. However, many different seeds are mapped into the same hash slots because of the high ununiformity of the human genome, and many fruitless key comparisons are performed. To equalize the slot size, we propose an optimized hash function that changes the bit masks adaptively. With this approach, it is possible to improve the performance of all FPGA short read mapping systems based on hash functions. The performance for the comparison in our FPGA system on a Xilinx XC7VX690T and XC6VLX240T can be improved two-times, and the total performance outperforms any existing FPGA systems.","1946-1488","978-0-9934-2800-5","10.1109/FPL.2015.7293938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293938","","Indexes;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Accuracy;Computers","","1","","13","","8 Oct 2015","2-4 Sept. 2015","2-4 Sept. 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The penetration characteristics of neutrons have made them indispensable in many fields, including nuclear physics, radiobiology, material science, and defense applications. However, neutrons are not easily detected due to the inevitable interference of gamma-induced signals. Thus, a PSD technique is commonly required to differentiate neutron and gamma radiation. A wide range of PSD algorithms have been developed yet remain constrained to offline analysis. While FPGA provides the necessary resources for realtime processing, related studies are currently fragmented and insufficiently in-depth. To fulfill that gap, this research presents an experimental evaluation of the performance of four robust PSD algorithms implemented on FPGA. The methods under test include zero-crossing (ZC), charge comparison (CC), falling edge percentage slope (FEPS), and partial charge-to-peak ratio (PCPR). A large and open-access dataset was utilized to test the designs. The performance analysis for each method is based on two criteria: discrimination quality and resource consumption. The results showed that the CC method offers high discrimination efficiency at the expense of resources, while the FEPS method trades off discrimination for lower resource consumption. The ZC and PCPR methods achieve a good balance between the two criteria; however, certain factors need to be carefully considered when deploying practical applications.","","979-8-3315-4477-5","10.1109/ICCCAS65806.2025.11102457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11102457","neutron detection;neutron gamma discrimination;neutrons and gamma rays;pulse shape discrimination","Performance evaluation;Materials science and technology;Shape;Pulse measurements;Shape measurement;Noise;Neutrons;Performance analysis;Field programmable gate arrays;Nuclear physics","","1","","26","IEEE","11 Aug 2025","23-25 May 2025","23-25 May 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We provide Jellyfish, an efficient sketch method that performs one-pass clustering over the network stream. One-pass clustering is realized by adapting the monitoring granularity from the whole network flow to fragments called subflows, which not only reduces the ingestion rate but also provides an efficient intermediate representation for the input to the sketch. Jellyfish provides the network-flow level query interface by reconstructing the network-flow level counters by merging subflow records from the same network flow. We provide probabilistic analysis of the expected accuracy of both existing sketch methods and Jellyfish. Real-world trace-driven experiments show that Jellyfish reduces the average estimation errors by up to six orders of magnitude for per-flow queries, by six orders of magnitude for entropy queries, and up to ten times for heavy-hitter queries.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2023.3251981","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61972409); Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC)(grant numbers:TRS T41-603/20- R,GRF-16213621,ITF ACCESS); Spanish I+D+i project TRAINER-A; MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033(grant numbers:PID2020-118011GB-C21); Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA Academia); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10079137","Subflow;sketch;hash collision;clustering;heavy hitter","Monitoring;Approximation error;Arrays;Real-time systems;Query processing;IEEE transactions;Hash functions","","","","28","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","Dec. 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The applicability of the methodology is illustrated in the Prototype Verification System (PVS) by proving the logical correctness of an FPGA implementation of the Gauss-Jordan matrix inversion algorithm (GJ). Correctness of this FPGA implementation is based on proving its functional equivalence (FEq) with an algebraic imperative definition of GJ.

This article proposes a fine-grained structured sparsity (FSS) paradigm. The pruned sparse matrices in this paradigm exhibit characteristics of ‘local randomness’ and ‘global regularity’.

How to support the emerging applications and computing frameworks with high resource utilization is a serious challenge. In this paper, we present a resource sharing platform which can support different types of applications and computing frameworks by adopting a job-resource description protocol. To improve the resource utilization without impairing the performances of applications, we propose a job-resource matching algorithm, called JRMatching, which deploys those different types of jobs on one node hybridly to reduce resource fragments, and a mechanism to provide resources adaptively, which can reduce resource waste caused by fixed resource allocation. The experiments show that the performances of applications sharing resources in one node are close to running exclusively and the resource utilization of the internet data center also can be improved.","","978-0-7695-5088-6","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832049","internet data center;job-resource description protocol;scalability;job-resource matching algorithm;resource utilization;performance","Resource management;Servers;Protocols;Games;Web services;Arrays","","","2","30","IEEE","12 Jun 2014","13-15 Nov. 2013","13-15 Nov. 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dissected chromosomes can be used in various conventional applications, including establishing probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the generation of chromosome band-specific libraries and physical mapping for cytogenetic analysis. For this purpose, several reports using micro- and nano-dissection methods by micromanipulators have been published. In the present study, we developed a functional chromosome nano-dissection chip that can dissect various chromosomes in one-chip by using the pattern chip with nano-scale porous anodic alumina. The porous anodic alumina, that makes use of self-organized nanoarray materials as a template for the pattern chip, has a highly oriented porous structure with uniform and nearly parallel pores that can be organized in an almost precise close-packed hexagonal structure. The most characteristic feature of this material has been emphasized with the extremely high aspect ratio of their channels that is difficult to achieve with conventional lithographic techniques. This chromosome nano-dissection chip can dissect directly a specific chromosome into a nano-scale pore without AFM dissection process. Thus, we expect that are chromosome nanoarray chip is very suitable for arraying chromosome fragments without the recovery process with the possibility of direct immobilization of chromosome fragments into nano-scale pore of this chip.","1944-9399","0-7803-9199-3","10.1109/NANO.2005.1500802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1500802","","Biological cells;DNA;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Probes;Fluorescence;Marine animals;Hybrid power systems;Libraries;Chromosome mapping","","","","5","IEEE","6 Sep 2005","15-15 July 2005","15-15 July 2005","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A second trend is that CPU performance advances are not only brought by increased clock rates, but also by increasing parallelism inside the CPU. Current database systems have not yet adapted to these trends and show poor utilization of both CPU and memory resources on current hardware. In this paper, we show how these resources can be optimized for large joins and translate these insights into guidelines for future database architectures, encompassing data structures, algorithms, cost modeling and implementation. In particular, we discuss how vertically fragmented data structures optimize cache performance on sequential data access. On the algorithmic side, we refine the partitioned hash-join with a new partitioning algorithm called ""radix-cluster"", which is specifically designed to optimize memory access. The performance of this algorithm is quantified using a detailed analytical model that incorporates memory access costs in terms of a limited number of parameters, such as cache sizes and miss penalties. We also present a calibration tool that extracts such parameters automatically from any computer hardware. The accuracy of our models is proven by exhaustive experiments conducted with the Monet database system on three different hardware platforms. Finally, we investigate the effect of implementation techniques that optimize CPU resource usage. Our experiments show that large joins can be accelerated almost an order of magnitude on modern RISC hardware when both memory and CPU resources are optimized.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1019210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019210","","Hardware;Partitioning algorithms;Database systems;Data structures;Delay;Clocks;Parallel processing;Guidelines;Cost function;Algorithm design and analysis","","128","4","40","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","July-Aug. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional Doppler shift estimators, such as the cyclic prefix (CP)-based estimator (CPBE), the two-training-symbol-based estimator (TBE), and the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), have inferior estimation accuracy especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we, therefore, propose three new Doppler shift estimators for mmWave communication systems on HSRs: a radio environment map (REM)-based estimator (RBE) derived from the maximum a posteriori algorithm; an equally-divided structure-based estimator (ESBE) that divides the effective orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing symbol (OFDM) into multiple equal fragments; and an enhanced ESBE (EESBE) that takes the results of RBE as a priori knowledge.

In conventional implementations, however, the system has to suspend the execution of applications while carrying out GC, which renders GC generally unsuitable for real-time processing systems. As a solution to this problem, Yuasa, et al. of Kyoto University developed the return-barrier method based on snapshot GC. Return-barrier enhances real-time GC processing over the original snapshot GC.

Unfortunately, no standard data communication mechanism has been defined for the communication between these elements. Therefore, O-DUs may not work efficiently in O-DU pool, limiting the RAN performance. This paper investigates an optimized solution for routing and packet scheduling, allowing multiple O-DU pools to communicate with their O-RUs meeting the requirements of different 5G classes of service. We propose an O-DU pool architecture and formulate the problem of optimal routing and packet scheduling to forward Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols over the optimal routes and map UDP packet sizes to fragment OFDM symbols. Numerical results show our solution can select the optimal routes and packet sizes to carry requested traffic.

The key idea is to express an operational plan, which is usually a sequence of system-built-in commands, as a text script. This script contains not only the conventional plan but also “logic”-type commands so that the operational plan can be expressed in the form of a program fragment such as “IF A THEN DO B”. Once this logic-type command is received, a remote system can change its behavior without requiring the software to be rebooted. Using this software architecture, we propose a new search algorithm using an orthogonal experiment design in the onboard planning and scheduling process; orthogonal experiment designs have been used in many quality control processes. Heuristics is used in conventional applications to create options for what to do next in the planning process, whereas here the focus is placed on transforming the conventional use of the orthogonal experiment design to create sufficient number of optional plans for the system to test as small as possible.

"Supervised DPCA Scheme Based on Reciprocal Filter for Clutter Cancelation From Moving OFDM Radar","A. Quirini; G. P. Blasone; F. Colone; P.

It has been shown that a range compression stage based on the reciprocal filter (RF) can be used in the signal processing scheme to mitigate the effects of the time-varying waveform on the space–time clutter cancelation. However, such an approach is effective only when the received signal is fragmented into batches consisting of individual OFDM symbols. In turn, this is a strong constraint for coherent processing technique since it affects the implementation of displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) cancelation, the equivalent pulse repetition frequency with the corresponding ambiguities and SNR losses. In order to relax this constraint, supervised thresholded reciprocal filtering strategies can be used, which enable operation over batches of any length, i.e., using a non-OFDM fragmentation, thus providing greater flexibility. However, such techniques were verified to have a nonnegligible impact on the clutter cancelation capability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a complete processing scheme that integrates the multichannel clutter suppression stage into the RF supervision strategy adopted at the range compression stage. The proposed approach is referred to as the thresholded DPCA based on RF (T-DPCA-RF) and is compared to alternatives when operating against simulated scenarios for the case of a radar equipped with two receiving channels. The performed analysis shows that the T-DPCA-RF allows a better tradeoff between clutter cancelation and target SNR while reducing the complexity of the system and enhancing its flexibility in practical cases. Preliminary tests against experimental data confirm these results.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2025.3527953","European Union under the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan(grant numbers:PE00000001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10841903","Clutter cancelation;displaced phase center antenna (DPCA);integrated sensing and communication (ISAC);joint radar and communication (JRC);moving platforms;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radar;reciprocal filter (RF);supervised reciprocal filter","Radar;OFDM;Clutter;Radar antennas;Radio frequency;Radar clutter;Signal to noise ratio;Symbols;Radar signal processing;Aerospace and electronic systems","","2","","29","CCBY","14 Jan 2025","June 2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To make full use of the parallel advantage of cloud computing, it is necessary to refactor the legacy code according to the programming model of cloud computing. Before that, the parallelizability analysis is the first thing to do. In this paper, an approach is proposed for the distributed parallelizability analysis of legacy code, which is based on the analysis of dependency between loop iterations. According to the categories of the traditional dependency, the dependency between loop iterations is divided into three types, and the judgment rules of the dependency between loop iterations are proposed. Then a Distributed Parallelizability Analysis Tool (DPAT) based on Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) was developed to identify and annotate the parallelizable loops. Experimental results show that the approach can effectively identify the parallelizable code fragments, which will be the target objects of refactoring. In contrast to the existing approaches, our method can identify parallelizability between loop iterations and not limit the type of the loop.","","978-1-7281-1141-4","10.1109/BDCloud.2018.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8672280","legacy code, abstract syntax tree, distributed parallelizability analysis, dependency between loop iterations","Cloud computing;Tools;Java;Syntactics;Distributed databases;Aging;Big Data","","2","","30","IEEE","21 Mar 2019","11-13 Dec. 2018","11-13 Dec. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, GPU drivers often include many heuristics to help optimize throughput. Recently however, new APIs are emerging which sacrifice many heuristics for lower-level hardware control and more predictable driver behavior. This shifts the burden for many optimizations from GPU driver developers to game programmers, but also provides numerous opportunities to exploit application-specific knowledge. This paper examines different opportunities for specializing GPU code and reducing redundant data transfers. Static analysis of commercial games shows that 5-18% of GPU code is specializable by pruning dead data elements or moving portions to different graphics pipeline stages. In some games, up to 97% of the programs' data inputs of a particular type, namely uniform variables, are unused, as well as up to 62% of those in the GPU internal vertex-fragment interface. This shows potential for improving memory usage and communication overheads. In some test scenarios, removing dead uniform data can lead to 6x performance improvements. We also explore the upper limits of specialization if all dynamic inputs are constant at run-time. For instance, if uniform inputs are constant, up to 44% of instructions can be eliminated in some games, with a further 14% becoming constant-foldable at compile time. Analysis of run-time traces, reveals that 48-91% of uniform inputs are constant in real games, so values close to the upper limit may be achieved in practice.","2641-7936","978-1-7281-3613-4","10.1109/PACT.2019.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891638","Compiler;Graphics;Shader;Specialization;Static Analysis;Compiler Optimization","Graphics processing units;Pipelines;Games;Optimization;Rendering (computer graphics);Transforms;Hardware","","2","","51","IEEE","7 Nov 2019","23-26 Sept. 2019","23-26 Sept. 2019","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article provides the first unified review of ISAC-enabled sensing for both human activities and environment, focusing on signal-level mechanisms, sensing features, and real-world feasibility. We begin by characterizing how diverse physical phenomena, ranging from human vital sign and motion to precipitation and flood dynamics, impact wireless signal propagation, producing measurable signatures in channel state information (CSI), Doppler profiles, and signal statistics. A comprehensive analysis is then presented across two domains: human sensing applications including localization, activity recognition, and vital sign monitoring; and environmental sensing for rainfall, soil moisture, and water level. Experimental results from long-term evolution (LTE) sensing under nonline-of-sight (NLOS) conditions are incorporated to highlight the feasibility in infrastructure-limited scenarios.

This paper presents a novel solution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected renewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The proposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that stabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable output. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather forecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems are charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary priority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries based on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) and deciding which to charge.

This task becomes particularly challenging in complex urban environments, especially when communication occurs over millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands, due to the fragmented coverage of cells in such situations. This paper studies the performance gains that is feasible when the trajectory of the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is selected according to the QoS that the 6G network can provide in different parts of a Manhattan grid layout. More precisely, a graph is constructed in which the nodes are the crossroads and the weight of the edges connecting nodes is proportional to the minimum Spectral Efficiency (SE) across the streets that connect the given intersections. Then, the end-to-end trajectory of the vehicle can be selected based on the Maximizing the Minimum (Max-Min) scheme, which maximizes the minimum SE, encountered by the AV. The simulation results show that the proposed Max-Min scheme achieves significant performance improvements, delivering notable gains in the order of 40%-60% (20%-30%) are observed for 10th (50th) percentile SE, when the trajectory from the starting point to the destination is optimized based on the coverage of the mobile network.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3543204","ASPIRE Award for Research Excellence under Grant Abu Dhabi Award for Research Excellence (AARE-2020)-368; United Arab Emirates University (UAEU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10891763","6G;autonomous driving;vehicle-to-network communication;QoS;trajectory planning;urban area;mmWave","Base stations;Quality of service;Millimeter wave communication;Trajectory;Signal to noise ratio;Reflection;Interference;6G mobile communication;Urban areas;Roads","","","","28","CCBY","18 Feb 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike terrestrial users, UAVs face frequent handovers due to antenna side-lobe coverage and fragmented aerial cell overlaps. Existing optimization strategies, however, are often limited to coarse-grained “whether-to-handover” decisions or unidirectional cell individual offset (CIO) tuning, resulting in degraded handover performance. To address these problems, this paper proposes an Event-triggered Bidirectional CIO Optimization with Hybrid prioritized experience replay based Deep Reinforcement Learning (EBCO-HDRL) algorithm. Under the A3 event-triggered mechanism, EBCO-HDRL jointly configures serving-to-neighbor and neighbor-to-serving CIOs, improving handover accuracy and reducing ping-pong events. An event-triggered optimization strategy adaptively reconfigures CIOs only when needed, mitigating computational overhead and enhancing training stability. To further improve sample efficiency, a Hybrid Prioritized Experience Replay (HPER) scheme is introduced, combining temporal-difference error and high-reward sampling, supported by a heterogeneous neural network design. Simulation results show that EBCO-HDRL significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of precision, stability, and robustness, offering an effective solution for UAV handover management in cellular IoT networks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2025.3645389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11303183","Cell Individual Offset;Cellular-Connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;Deep Reinforcement Learning","Handover;Optimization;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Event detection;Internet of Things;Antennas;Decision making;Hysteresis;Trajectory;Stability criteria","","","","","IEEE","18 Dec 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this context, the ability to monitor, manage, and optimize energy flows at the household level becomes critical-not only for improving energy efficiency but also for enabling active participation in emerging smart grid services. However, current practices for monitoring small to medium-scale photovoltaic installations (typically 15 to 100 kW), especially in residential and tertiary buildings, often rely on manual or fragmented approaches that do not capture the full potential of these systems. This paper investigates the integration of smart home energy monitoring platforms, such as Home Assistant, into residential environments with PV generation, highlighting their ability to collect high-resolution, real-time data, support automation, and interface with a wide range of devices and inverters. These systems are fundamental in enabling local demand response, facilitating user awareness, and ultimately participating in community-scale energy management schemes. The work also explores how such platforms can serve as the basis for future aggregator frameworks by providing the infrastructure to measure, predict, and adjust household energy consumption dynamically.

Building on this index, a multi-criteria optimization model based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied to evaluate five policy scenarios, ranging from direct subsidies to integrated mixes of efficiency retrofits and decentralized renewables. The case study demonstrates that the integrated scenario reduces CEPI by 45% compared to baseline, highlighting the significant potential of coordinated strategies over fragmented measures. The originality of this study lies in the adapted design of CEPI for Romania, the integration of socio-economic and technical dimensions within an optimization model, and its validation through a quantitative case study. These findings provide novel, evidence-based insights to guide Romania's policy alignment with EU climate and social objectives.","","979-8-3315-8511-2","10.1109/SIELMEN67352.2025.11260733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11260733","energy poverty mitigation;optimization;particle swarm optimization;index","Costs;Optimization models;Prevention and mitigation;District heating;Particle measurements;Distance measurement;Indexes;Particle swarm optimization;Socioeconomics;Optimization","","","","19","IEEE","3 Dec 2025","16-18 Oct. 2025","16-18 Oct. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has long been recognized for its versatile applications in the pharmaceutical industry, with its use in the formulation of various topical medications, wound care products, and drug delivery systems. For pharmaceutical use, petrolatum has to meet the quality standards described in its Pharmacopoeia monograph. The comprised test ranges allow for a broad range of Vaseline qualities on the market, while the tests themselves only poorly discriminate between grades. The only differentiating properties are related to the melting behavior, which is tested via drop point analysis, and the consistency, addressed in the functionality-related characteristics section. In this study, we propose the hypothesis that Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) could be a comparably simple method to evaluate the crystalline behavior of Vaseline qualities. We expect such information to provide additional details for Vaseline quality discrimination. This discrimination would allow the most suitable petroleum jelly to be selected for an existing formulation when the previous one needs to be replaced; for example, due to a manufacturer change. We demonstrate that NIRS in transmission and reflectance mode obtained by traditional continuous spectra acquisition and fragmented NIR spectra acquisition through multi-optical, multi-modal excitation, respectively, can both serve as a basis for detecting Vaseline quality differences, which we have further proven by thermal analysis and tests with semisolid formulations. Additionally, we demonstrate that a lower-cost multi-optical spectrometer in reflectance mode can detect Vaseline quality differences in rotated samples.","2378-363X","978-1-6654-9313-0","10.1109/INDIN51400.2023.10218318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10218318","multimodal sensing;crystalline materials;microstructure;rotation measurement;PCA;calorimetry;pharmaceuticals;European Pharmacopoeia","Reflectivity;Industries;Wounds;Hydrocarbons;Behavioral sciences;Thermal analysis;Sensors","","","","16","IEEE","22 Aug 2023","18-20 July 2023","18-20 July 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Runtime exceptions can cause serious consequences like system crashes. Today's programs are still likely to contain a large number of runtime exceptions, such as null pointer exceptions and arithmetic exceptions in real-world bugs, indicating that the error-checking strategy is insufficient to clear the occurrence of runtime exceptions.

To this end, this paper proposes a low-altitude digital-intelligent network (LADIN) as an overarching architecture, with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) serving as the core enabling technology that pervasively unifies its three layers. At the heterogeneous infrastructure layer, we detail an ISAC waveform design based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, enabling dual-purpose hardware to simultaneously achieve high-speed data transmission and high-precision environmental sensing. Within the intelligent data fusion layer, ISAC's role expands into a multimodal fusion paradigm, providing the crucial electromagnetic sensing modality. This layer constructs a unified spatiotemporal feature space by introducing pluggable back-projection adapters and spatiotemporal modeling. These adapters systematically integrate heterogeneous data from ISAC, optical cameras, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) by inverting their respective observation models, thereby overcoming representational disparities and association ambiguities. At the service and management layer, this coherent representation directly drives algorithmic processes and control policies. ISAC resources are virtualized into dynamically allocable assets, enabling closed-loop control that responds to the real-time state of the feature space, such as reconfiguring base station operational modes based on live situational awareness. Validation through multi-frequency collaborative sensing and multimodal fusion use cases demonstrates significant performance gains in tracking robustness, detection of near-zero radar cross-section targets such as balloons, and seamless urban airspace governance, conclusively establishing the transformative potential of a deeply integrated, ISAC-centric approach for future LAE systems.","2095-9230","","10.1631/FITEE.2500547","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L232003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62341101,62321001,62401077,62472048); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB4300403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11345611","Low-altitude economy;Integrated sensing and communication;Airspace management;Uncrewed aerial vehicles;Cyber-physical system","Adaptation models;Target tracking;Data integration;Collaboration;Integrated sensing and communication;Radar tracking;Hardware;Robustness;Data models;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","","","26","","12 Jan 2026","December 2025","","ZUP","ZUP Journals"

This paper conducts a scoping review to systematically analyze DT-based forecasting approaches and benchmark them against advanced non-DT methods. Findings show that DTs can improve forecasting accuracy by up to 60%, particularly under high-variability conditions, but face challenges in scalability, complexity, and data requirements. To address these, the paper proposes a novel conceptual framework integrating layered DT architecture with probabilistic AI, federated learning, and large language models.

However, logs on a distributed system are often fragmented, making it challenging to achieve unified processing and comprehension. Traditional methods for log-based anomaly detection often employ machine learning algorithms with a focus on log event counts or log sequences. However, traditional methods fall short of fully leveraging the temporal and spatial structures inherent in distributed system logs, leading to issues of false positives and unstable performance in anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a novel log anomaly detection method based on the construction of distributed system workflow graphs. This method extracts spatio-temporal information from distributed system logs and constructs event workflow graphs. These graphs accurately reflect the execution of the system and provide more comprehensive support for anomaly detection based on distributed system logs. The experimental results demonstrated that STGraph achieved F1 scores of 0.959,0.979, and 0.959 on HDFS, BGL, and OpenStack datasets respectively, outperforming LogRobust, PLELog, and NeuralLog by 1.2%-18.6% across precision/recall metrics.

"Meteoroid flaring as a possible source of intense Langmuir waves","J. D. Mathews; F. T.

While several such events have been observed, we concentrate on one particularly interesting event. For this ~90 km event, the head-echo at both frequencies is indicative of multiple fragments and of flaring based on the approach described by Mathews et al. [1]. The UHF radar meteor head-echo yields evidence of two major fragments but did not show the meteoroid flare while only the much less sensitive but wider-beam VHF radar revealed the unusual “delayed-echo” feature as well as complex fragmentation and the progenitor flare. For this event the flare and the resultant delayed-echo feature were well defined in the Range-Time-Intensity results and together point to an apparent propagation speed of the process giving rise to the delayed-echo of 50-100 km/sec. This is far too fast for shock waves thus pointing to intense plasma waves generated in the presumably “explosive” termination of a meteoroid fragment that produced the intense, well-defined radar flare-echo. We assume that the plasma “waves” generated by the explosive flare propagate in the trail-plasma “waveguide” and produce strong, highly non-thermal perturbations in the distribution of the trail-plasma thus engendering the observed strong VHF radar scattering at 1-2 km delay from the flare. We note convincing recent reports [2 and references therein] of transient HF/VHF radio emissions seen from the LWA1 (Long Wavelength Array prototype) and identified as originating from along the trajectory of optical bolides observed by a network of meteor cameras. Obenberger et al. [2] attribute these emissions to mode conversion to RF of Langmuir waves in the large gradients of the trail plasma. We agree with this assessment and, based on our delayed-echo results, further suggest that the meteoroid flaring generates these waves and also that the waves are contained within the trail-plasma waveguide thus limiting dissipation. We have not seen evidence of RF emission in our observations.","","978-90-825987-0-4","10.23919/URSIGASS.2017.8105190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8105190","","Radar;Radio frequency;Stimulated emission;Optical scattering;Optical imaging;Trajectory","","2","","10","","13 Nov 2017","19-26 Aug. 2017","19-26 Aug. 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, up-to-date information about the samples must be readily available when analyzing experiments done with the resulting microarray slides. A human chromosome 22 project (HC22) at Yale's Center for Excellence in Genomic Sciences (CEGS) used manual sample tracking and handcrafted data files for analyzing the array. The difficulties of manual sample tracking on this project limited the array layout and increased the development time. For subsequent microarray development projects at the Yale CEGS it was decided to build the comprehensive Sample Tracking and Analysis Research Support (STARS) System described herein. The system had to be portable since there are many projects at Yale and elsewhere that require automated microarray sample tracking. Informatics issues in designing and implementing CEGS/STARS are described. The system tracks plates, PCR scoring, microarray slides, and slide printings as core features. CEGS/STARS can support multiple projects and currently there are three sample tracking projects based on the same code and data base design: HC22 and HPR (human promoter) for projects in the Yale CEGS Center, and FLY for projects in the Yale School of Medicine Drosophila Center. In addition to the core tracking features, CEGS/STARS also tracks the biological experiments performed with the resulting microarrays. CEGS/STARS enhances the PCR-based array production protocol with a ""cherry picking"" algorithm that supports dynamic spot site decisions. Other features include: laboratory robot script generation, lab equipment file generation, automated PCR process scoring, automated links to bioinformatics data analysis tools, annotation and re-annotation of DNA fragments, links to genome databases, and publishing results to GEO. The advanced features of the system are currently being used to produce a human genome promoter array, a drosophila tiling array, and a drosophila promoter array.

"Contemporary advances in physics, XXII transmutation","K. K. Darrow",NA,The Bell System Technical Journal,"29 Apr 2014","1931","10","4","628","655","In this paper are described experiments made at the Cavendish Laboratory, in Vienna, in Chicago and elsewhere during the last fifteen years in which atom nuclei have been disrupted by swiftly moving alpha particles ejected by radioactive materials. Whether an atom is an atom of gold, or of tin, or of praesodymium, or one of some other of the ninety-two varieties is determined solely by the magnitude of its nuclear charge. When the disruption of atom nuclei occurs spontaneously, as it does among atoms of the radioactive elements, the fragments are nuclei of charge different from that of the exploded atom. When disruption is brought about by design, as it is in the experiments described in this article, we have again the disappearance of atoms of one species and the appearance of atoms of other species. The cases differ in that in the first the action goes on without let or hindrance, while in the second it is, to a certain extent, under the control of the experimenter. The experimenter may, if he chooses, congratulate himself on having solved the age old problem of the transmutation of elements. However, transmutation as such is not the object of these investigations. If it were their success would have to be rated as altogether negligible, for the quantities of material transmuted are much less than can be detected chemically. The real object of the work, as is made abundantly clear, has been to verify and to extend our knowledge of the constitution of the nucleus. This is a subject about which a great deal is yet to be learned, but one on which the physicist has already many strong convictions based on a considerable array of interrelated and consistent data. The various conclusions regarding the constitution of atom nuclei which had been reached before any of these experiments on artificial disintegration were made, are discussed. The results of the investigations described confirm and extend our knowledge of the constitution of the nucleus.","0005-8580","","10.1002/j.1538-7305.1931.tb02335.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6768072","","","","1","","","","29 Apr 2014","Oct. 1931","","Nokia Bell Labs","Nokia Bell Labs Journal"

Most are derived from high-grade metasediments of pelitic–psammitic composition, and migmatites are common. Among these, discrete fragments of melanosomes rich in cordierite and garnet are restites from partial melting. However, compositional and Nd–Sr isotopic data indicate they are not restite in equilibrium with the melt component of the host magma, but may have formed part of a spectrum of diverse magma source lithologies. Alternatively, they may be accidental xenoliths. Regardless of their origin, data for these enclaves suggest their precursors could represent deeply buried age equivalents of the ubiquitous Ordovician turbidites of the Lachlan Fold Belt. Three types of microgranular enclaves with igneous textures are distinguished. The most common type are small and rounded mafic enclaves of tonalitic composition. They carry xenocrysts derived from the host magma, and some contain high-Mg pyroxene derived from a mafic magma. Isotopic data form an array with εNd from −6 to −12, and 87Sr/86Sr from 0.7130 to 0.7167 (host rock −10 and 0.715, respectively). These enclaves formed as globules of hybrid mafic magma commingled with, and contaminated by, the more felsic host magma. Other enclave types were derived from disrupted syn-plutonic dykes having a distinct isotopic composition, and from a cogenetic marginal facies of the host.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petroj/38.7.815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8153324","enclaves;magma mixing;xenocrysts;Nd–Sr isotopes;S-type granites;Lachlan Fold Belt","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","July 1997","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The present study supports the conclusions of our previous James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey and suggests that, in contrast with some theoretical predictions, most pre-stellar cores have flat inner density gradients that only approach ρ (r) ∝ r−2 beyond a few thousand au. Several of the cores have a filamentary-like morphology and are apparently fragmented in a small number (̃ 2–4) of subclumps. This implies that the initial conditions for protostellar collapse depart significantly from a singular isothermal sphere.

The deduplication efficiency improves for smaller chunk sizes, however the files become highly fragmented requiring many disk accesses during reconstruction or chattiness in a client-server architecture. Within the sequence of chunks that an object (file) is decomposed into, sub-sequences of adjacent chunks tend to repeat. We exploit this insight to optimize the chunk sizes by joining repeated sub-sequences of small chunks into new super chunks with the constraint to achieve practically the same matching performance. We employ suffix arrays to find these repeating sub-sequences and to determine a new encoding that covers the original sequence. With super chunks we significantly reduce fragmentation, improving reconstruction time and the overall deduplication ratio by lowering the amount of metadata. As a result, fewer chunks are used to represent a file, reducing the number of disk accesses needed to reconstruct the file and requiring fewer entries in the chunk dictionary and fewer hashes to encode a file. To encode a sequence of chunks we proved two facts: (1) any subsequence that repeats is part of some super chunk (su- permaximal in Figure 1) - therefore the dictionary contains just supermaximals and non-repeats, and (2) maximals are the only repeats not covered (overlapped) by the containing supermaximals - so once we discover the maximals with the suffix array, and encode them, there is no need for maintaining auxiliary data structures like bit masks, to guarantee the coverage (encoding) of the entire object. Our experimental evaluation (Figure 2) yields a reduction in fragmentation between 89%-97% and a reduction of dictionary metadata (number of entries) between 80%-97%, without increasing the total amount of storage required for unique chunks.","2375-0359","978-1-4244-3753-5","10.1109/DCC.2009.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976496","Data deduplication;Information archiving;Storage backup;File chunking","Dictionaries;Samarium;Encoding;Data compression;Optimization methods;Constraint optimization;Data structures","","6","4","","IEEE","26 May 2009","16-18 March 2009","16-18 March 2009","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In response to the demands of modern multi-system communication and indoor environments, omnidirectional antennas with broad bandwidth, miniaturization, and low profile have become a research hotspot in recent years. This report mainly introduces three types of omnidirectional antennas for indoor mobile base station. Firstly, an ultrawideband omnidirectional patch antenna with vertical polarization and low profile is introduced. It composes of a circular patch, eight short pins and a circular ground plane. Two propagation modes of TM01 and TM02 are produced when the circular patch is excited by a 1-to-8 power divider, while other two propagation modes of TM01 and TM02 are additionally excited by embedding two ring slots in the ground plane. A circular slot is then loaded in the circular patch to enhance the impedance matching at the higher frequency band, thus widening the operating bandwidth. By using such a new mechanism, the multiple modes are combined to realize good impedance matching and omnidirectional radiation with vertical polarization during an ultrawide bandwidth of 110% (1.57-5.39 GHz). Secondly, a horizontal-polarized omnidirectional antenna with an extremely wide bandwidth and small gain variation is proposed. To attain horizontal-polarized omnidirectional performance and small size, eight shared dipoles, which are round-connected into an octagon-shaped array, are excited by a 1-to-8 power divider. To significantly improve the impedance matching and omnidirectional performance over a very broad operating frequency band, fragmented metal strips are introduced around the shared dipoles. In the proposed design, a desirable bandwidth of 92.3% (1.4−3.8 GHz) is obtained under a compact size of π × (0.32 λL)2 × 0.01 λL. Apart from that, the wideband antenna also attains excellent gain variation of smaller than 1.5 dB at the operating band. Finally, an effective design method for an aperture-shared broadband dual-polarized omnidirectional antenna with a very low profile is introduced. An ultra-low-profile verticalpolarized omnidirectional antenna is realized by utilizing a 1- to-4 power divider to excite a metal disk with four fan-shaped slots, which is located upon a circular reflector and connected to the reflector by twelve identical metal pillars. Then a horizontal-polarized omnidirectional element, which is designed based on an 8-unit dipole array, is fed by a broadband 1-to-8 power divider. To attain an aperture-shared dual-polarized antenna, the reflector of the vertical-polarized antenna is replaced by the horizontal-polarized element. In this innovative scheme, the dual-polarized omnidirectional antenna achieves a wide co-frequency bandwidth of 95% (1.6−4.5 GHz) and an ultra-low profile of about 0.05λL.","2994-3124","979-8-3503-8996-8","10.1109/ICMMT61774.2024.10671989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10671989","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jan 2026","16-19 May 2024","16-19 May 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Focusing ultrasound through the skull can be accomplished by adding a phase correction to each element of a hemispherical transducer array. The phase corrections are determined with acoustic simulations that rely on speed of sound estimates derived from CT scans. While several studies have investigated the relationship between acoustic velocity and CT Hounsfield units (HUs), these studies have largely ignored the impact of X-ray energy, reconstruction method, and reconstruction kernel on the measured HU, and therefore the estimated velocity, and none have measured the relationship directly. In this paper, 91 ex vivo human skull fragments from two skulls are imaged by 80 CT scans with a variety of energies and reconstruction methods. The average HU from each fragment is found for each scan and correlated with the speed of sound measured using a through transmission technique in that fragment. As measured by the  $R$ -squared value, the results show that CT is able to account for 23%–53% of the variation in velocity in the human skull. Both the X-ray energy and the reconstruction technique significantly alter the  $R$ -squared value and the linear relationship between HU and speed of sound in bone. Accounting for these variations will lead to more accurate phase corrections and more efficient transmission of acoustic energy through the skull.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2827899","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01 MH111825,PO1 CA159992); Focused Ultrasound Foundation; GE Healthcare; In-Sightec; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8340162","Acoustic propagation;acoustics;biomedical acoustics;biomedical imaging;computed tomography;high intensity focused ultrasound","Computed tomography;Acoustics;Velocity measurement;Acoustic measurements;Bones;Kernel;Energy measurement","Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Photons;Skull;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Ultrasonography","61","","57","IEEE","17 Apr 2018","July 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Internet controller (INC), the tactical router for TIDB, is governed by the MIL-STD-188-220B protocol. This protocol specifies a number of interrelated link layer and radio parameters that have significant cross-correlation. As a result the Taguchi robust design technique, which permits optimization of several central factors concurrently, is particularly well suited for the problem of optimizing network performance for a given scenario. The most critical control factors hate been shown to be parameters related to the net access delay (V-NAD) scheduler algorithm and the Type 4 queue structure. The key objective is to determine the MIL-STD-188-220B parameter values that optimize performance in a fragmented net, with voice, situation awareness (SA), and Type 4 data traffic using the ITT TIDB Phase III OPNET-based networking model. Optimization is performed using the dynamic Taguchi robust design method. The matrix experiments are conducted with an L/sub 18/ orthogonal array. One of the most critical processes for the optimization of throughput with minimal delay is identification of the ideal function. Message completion and delay time are combined into a single quality characteristic for the purpose of maximizing the probability of delivering a message at a given delay time. Based on the Taguchi robust design experiments, three optimum sets, each yielding different scheduler speed, are recommended. Of the three sets, the one with the slowest scheduler speed, provides the greatest improvement in performance of the mission critical C2 multicast and unicast messages.","","0-7803-6521-6","10.1109/MILCOM.2000.904926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904926","","Robustness;Design optimization;Protocols;Delay effects;IP networks;Telecommunication traffic;Network topology;Internet;Scheduling algorithm;Communication system traffic control","","1","","4","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","22-25 Oct. 2000","22-25 Oct. 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interestingly, for various amount of atoms we obtained three regions of rmin with different geometries: linear chains for small distances less than 0.4λ0, fragments of triangular lattice for intermediate distances and fragments of square lattice for large distances close to λ0.

To perform genome sequencing, devices extract small random fragments of an organism's DNA sequence (known as reads). The first step of genome sequence analysis is a computational process known as read mapping. In read mapping, each fragment is matched to its potential location in the reference genome with the goal of identifying the original location of each read in the genome. Unfortunately, rapid genome sequencing is currently bottlenecked by the computational power and memory bandwidth limitations of existing systems, as many of the steps in genome sequence analysis must process a large amount of data. A major contributor to this bottleneck is approximate string matching (ASM), which is used at multiple points during the mapping process. ASM enables read mapping to account for sequencing errors and genetic variations in the reads. We propose GenASM, the first ASM acceleration framework for genome sequence analysis. GenASM performs bitvectorbased ASM, which can efficiently accelerate multiple steps of genome sequence analysis. We modify the underlying ASM algorithm (Bitap) to significantly increase its parallelism and reduce its memory footprint. Using this modified algorithm, we design the first hardware accelerator for Bitap. Our hardware accelerator consists of specialized systolic-array-based compute units and on-chip SRAMs that are designed to match the rate of computation with memory capacity and bandwidth, resulting in an efficient design whose performance scales linearly as we increase the number of compute units working in parallel. We demonstrate that GenASM provides significant performance and power benefits for three different use cases in genome sequence analysis. First, GenASM accelerates read alignment for both long reads and short reads. For long reads, GenASM outperforms state-of-the-art software and hardware accelerators by 116× and 3.9×, respectively, while reducing power consumption by 37× and 2.7×. For short reads, GenASM outperforms state-of-the-art software and hardware accelerators by 111× and 1.9×. Second, GenASM accelerates pre-alignment filtering for short reads, with 3.7× the performance of a state-of-the-art pre-alignment filter, while reducing power consumption by 1.7× and significantly improving the filtering accuracy. Third, GenASM accelerates edit distance calculation, with 22-12501× and 9.3-400× speedups over the state-of-the-art software library and FPGA-based accelerator, respectively, while reducing power consumption by 548-582× and 67×. We conclude that GenASM is a flexible, high-performance, and low-power framework, and we briefly discuss four other use cases that can benefit from GenASM.","","978-1-7281-7383-2","10.1109/MICRO50266.2020.00081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9251930","","Sequential analysis;Sequences;Genomics;Hardware;Software;Acceleration;Bioinformatics","","78","","182","IEEE","11 Nov 2020","17-21 Oct. 2020","17-21 Oct. 2020","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method was developed for the silicon detectors of the 4π array CHIMERA and, consequently, it was implemented in a compact NIM module. This implementation allows for charge discrimination of fragments with charge Z < 15 and energy threshold as low as 4.5 MeV/nucleon (for Z = 6). This result is the natural follow on of a previous work recently done for the large area planar silicon detectors of CHIMERA, where the silicon detectors were used in both direct and reverse injection. The good performance of the constant fraction discrimination (CFD) required to trigger a start signal allowed to use this signal for time of flight (TOF) methods.","1082-3654","1-4244-0560-2","10.1109/NSSMIC.2006.356208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4179047","","Pulse shaping methods;Shape;Silicon;Detectors;Nuclear electronics;Optical design;Energy resolution;Signal resolution;Energy loss;Telescopes","","3","","6","IEEE","7 May 2007","29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inverse transformation, induction variable substitution, can also speed up loops by decreasing register requirements, although it is typically a normalizing step in the detection of array dependences by parallelizing compilers. The author presents a simple framework for performing these transformations. In contrast to previous approaches to strength reduction, no unnecessary temporary variables or dead code fragments are introduced, only relevant intermediate language fragments are examined, iteration test replacement is not handled as a special case, and the execution time of the target code is never increased. The method is particularly easy to visualize, making it a useful teaching tool as well.<>","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.21730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=21730","","Error analysis;Predictive models;Software systems;Frequency;Equations;Large-scale systems;Testing;Fluctuations;Programming profession;Linear regression","","1","","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","Jan. 1989","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Oil well conductors attached to the platform and many other metallic structures were also displaced and scattered across the existing sea floor. In 2022, Couvillion engaged Kraken Robotics to deploy their proprietary imaging technology, Acoustic Coring (AC), to image these conductors, currently buried beneath a 30 to 45 m thick layer of delta-released sediments below the mudline. The three-dimensional imaging technology, developed by [1], was designed for the shallow sub-seabed to identify and characterize geohazards and stratigraphy. This technology requires specular and non-specular returns with spatial accuracies that exceed those of current conventional seismic surveys (i.e., towed streamer-based methods) [2]. This was achieved through sub-seabed interrogation using a stationary transmitter and receiver array, which holds a spatially centimetre-spaced network across a horizontal imaging dimension of 14 metres [1] [2]. A total of 63 AC scans, consisting of 21 rows along three scanning columns spanning a 205 m x 60 m survey area, were conducted to determine the extent, expanse, orientation, and characteristics of lost conductor pipes. Of significance were continuous linear conductors reposing onto a basement geology lying directly across from the containment dome towards the location of the original conductor bay, following the basement slope closely. The pipes' endings show an abrupt spread-out termination with an undulating humped, slightly down-looking character around survey Row 11. In the region around this termination, gas-laden soil inhibited the acoustic ability to get acoustic returns and collect further data. It was postulated that the conductors were severed at this location, no longer existed, or continued uninterrupted toward the original oil well location. To help clarify the possibilities, a high-resolution magnetometer survey comprised of four three-component flux gate magnetometers integrated into a Millenium Plus ROV was conducted. The aim was to survey a region defined as an area of 460m (1509ft) by 405m (1328ft) to determine whether magnetometer data collected beyond Row 11 and extending toward the conductor bay could indicate the presence of buried pipes. The high-quality magnetic data showed continuity and agreement with the pre-survey modelling results. The results concorded with the acoustic conductor features mapped initially, and the responding magnetic lobes were consistent with debris targets predicted by modelling. Out-of-plane influences, such as the rotated displaced oil rig platform and heavy accumulation of metal debris around the original well, complicated the signals. However, the recorded magnetic data by itself shows a termination of the high-intensity lobe 40 m NE of the known location of the well conductor bay. The nature and geometry of the conductor bundle, as it extended beyond the last imaged location in the AC and towards the well bay, was not easily deciphered by common human vision-driven interpretation of magnetic data. To obtain this information, extensive AI -based modelling was developed utilizing the precision and details of the Acoustic Corer data results to train the AI system on the magnetometer data [5]. The 3D Training Models were created using an 8 GPU computer cluster handling 110 Epochs (in computing, an epoch is a fixed date and time used as a reference from which a computer measures system time). High-performance cloud-based computation clusters from AWS were deployed to simulate forward models to generate input training data rapidly. 202,000 3D training models and their magnetic response at 2 m intervals (high resolution) were generated. A deep learning architecture was then deployed to learn how to predict the underlying 3D magnetic model from the simulated response. This was achieved on another cloud-based system hosted by Shadeform, utilizing a network of 8 GPU machines, each equipped with 80 GB RAM. In this paper, the AI imagery is presented. It shows that damage to the well site is evident, revealing debris around the original well and where the conductors appear after Row 11. The continuity trend of the conductor pipes exhibits variation in signal strength responses beyond Row 11, indicating that past Row 11 and nearing the location of the original well, the conductors have sustained damage and may contain separated and fragmented pipes. However, the AI enhancements delineate continuity, highlight the trajectory of the pipe infrastructure toward the well placement, and partially encircle it. Simultaneously, a secondary parallel conductor trajectory branches off and leads forty meters north of the original well. This secondary trajectory consists of fragmented conductors or pipe-related debris and terminates where the high survey-based magnetic main anomaly lobe also concludes. As will be shown in the paper, the resulting magnetometer imagery was influenced by a complicated geometry of scattered metallic debris. Aspects of the critical conductor system, as imaged in detail by the Acoustic Corer, correlated well. The conductor package continues beyond Row 11; the last imaged location of the conductors seen in the acoustic thins out in places but continues towards the original well bay, albeit 40 m to the northeast, as suggested by the high anomaly lobe in the magnetic data. However, the AI imaging brought out a hidden subtle secondary branch of the conductor package veering and connecting with the metallic debris near the well bay, establishing clear evidence of a potential flow path from the well bay back to the downed jacket and oil /gas collection dome. These results could be achieved only through the fusion of acoustic imaging, magnetic data, and the intensive AI Deep Learning analysis that could look deep into the magnetic responses to reveal the subtle, hidden, buried features at higher discriminating resolutions.","","979-8-3315-3747-0","10.1109/OCEANS58557.2025.11104559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11104559","seismic processing;high resolution;magnetic imaging;Machine Learning;oil spill remediation","Magnetic flux;Magnetometers;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic separation;Magnetic cores;Magnetoacoustic effects;Conductors;Acoustics;Trajectory;Artificial intelligence","","","","6","IEEE","11 Aug 2025","16-19 June 2025","16-19 June 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the DNA genome assembly input datasets in most cases have a very large amount of data, it is important to develop custom architectures in order to speed up these processes and gain significant execution time reduction. In this paper we present the Reads Matching Filter (RMF), an input dataset prefiltering process, based on string matching and implemented on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology, in order to reduce the genome assembly execution time. The outputs of the RMF running on the FPGA as well as the original input dataset are given as input to the Velvet genome assembler which produces the assembly of the input sequences. The Velvet genome assembler is based on the manipulation of de Bruijn graphs, and produces its output via the removal of errors and the simplication of repeated regions. The FPGA-based RMF pre-filtering process manages to speedup the entire genome assembly processing, including I/O, by up to 6 times, while maintaining the quality of the output sequence contigs (i.e. the series of overlapping DNA sequences).","2471-7819","978-1-6654-4261-9","10.1109/BIBE52308.2021.9635499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9635499","FPGA accelerator;genome assembly;dataset filtering;Velvet;de Bruijn graphs","Matched filters;Power demand;Filtering;Genomics;DNA;Computer architecture;Logic gates","","","","14","IEEE","15 Dec 2021","25-27 Oct. 2021","25-27 Oct. 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A method of evaluating cache performance is required, both to give quantitative predictions of miss-ratio and information to guide optimization of cache use. Traditional cache simulation gives accurate predictions of miss-ratio, but little to direct optimization, Also, the simulation time is usually far greater than the program execution time. Several analytical models have been developed, but concentrate mainly on direct-mapped caches, often for specific types of algorithm, or to give qualitative predictions. Novel analytical models of cache phenomena are presented, applicable to numerical codes consisting mostly of array operations in looping constructs. Set-associative caches are considered, through an extensive hierarchy of cache reuse and interference effects, including numerous forms of temporal and spatial locality. Models of each effect are given which, when combined, predict the overall miss-ratio. An advantage is that the models also indicate sources of cache interference. The accuracy of the models is validated through example program fragments. The predicted miss-ratios are compared with simulations and shown typically to be within 15 percent. The evaluation time of the models is shown to be independent of the problem size, generally several orders of magnitude faster than simulation.","1557-9956","","10.1109/12.805152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=805152","","Analytical models;Predictive models;Interference;Performance analysis;Optimization methods;Software performance;Data analysis;Delay;Clocks;Monitoring","","26","","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","Oct. 1999","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the characteristics of existing models were analyzed and an effective road recognition method was explored, we found that capturing long-range dependencies helps improve road recognition. Therefore, a novel global-aware deep network (GAN) for road detection is proposed, in which the spatial-aware module (SAM) was applied to capture spatial context dependencies and the channel-aware module (CAM) was applied to capture the interchannel dependencies. Through establishing the relationships between spatial contexts and between channels, the GAN could effectively alleviate the road recognition problems, and the advantages of the proposed approach were validated on the public DeepGlobe road dataset.

Previously, we demonstrated that the OpenPET detector can be sufficiently operated in off-beam experiments after carbon beam irradiation. In this presentation, we reported the results of in-beam measurements with a prototype OpenPET detector optimized for the in-beam measurement. Experiments were performed in the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. The OpenPET detector consisted of a 8 × 8 × 4 LGSO crystal array and a 64-channel PS-PMT. The size of the crystals was 2.9mm × 2.9mm × 5.0mm. The energy and intensity of the 12C beam were 290MeV/u and 108 -109 particle per second (pps). This beam condition is similar to the actual treatment condition in HIMAC. Carbon ions entered to a water phantom and all of the primary carbon ions were stopped in the water. The OpenPET detector was positioned 30cm apart from the backside of the water phantom at an angle of 30 degree. A coincidence detector was positioned at the opposite side of the water phantom. As a result, the sufficient crystal identification performance was achieved with slight deterioration of the position histograms.","1082-3654","978-1-4244-9105-6","10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5874433","","Detectors;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Crystals;Histograms;Positron emission tomography;Carbon","","3","","3","IEEE","13 Jun 2011","30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Microarrays basically consist of a matrix of thousands or even more spots of DNA fragments or oligonucleotides arranged on a microscope slide. If a probe, marked with fluorescent molecules, containing a base sequence complementary to one in the array is spread onto the slide, hybridization takes place and the hybridized spot can be easily located by fluorescent imaging. Presently, a laser scanner and a photomultiplier are used for DNA microarray reading and the discrimination between different markers is made on the basis of different absorption/emission wavelengths. In the present paper we introduce, for the first time to our knowledge, a technique to read DNA microarrays based on an intensified CCD camera having a picosecond resolution electronic shutter. This device permits to map the fluorescence intensity in a microarray in just one shot.","","0-7803-6319-1","10.1109/CLEOE.2000.910314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910314","","DNA;Charge coupled devices;Fluorescence;Genetics;Microscopy;Probes;Sequences;Photomultipliers;Absorption;Charge-coupled image sensors","","1","1","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","10-15 Sept. 2000","10-15 Sept. 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The data comprised arrival times for compressional waves from 148 teleseismic events recorded on a temporary array of 40 digital seismographs spanning an area of 200 × 300 km. A new irregular shortest path ray tracer and non-linear inversion scheme were used to map the crust- and upper-mantle structure. Synthetic 3-D imaging tests were first performed to validate the procedure and establish resolution limits for the particular earthquake distribution and recording geometry.Wave speed anomalies of up to 4 per cent relative to the IASP91 layered earth model were found. The boundary between a prominent velocity high and a prominent velocity low in the shallow (crustal) depth slices seems to coincide with the synclinal axis of Adelaidean and Early Palaeozoic sediments. Other velocity features at shallow depths correlate with gravity highs and lows, and compare favourably with structure revealed from explosion seismic profiles recorded in the area. At depths greater than 60 km, the tomographic images reveal isolated velocity highs enclosed by regions of lower velocity within the fold belt. These features, of dimensions tens of kilometres, could indicate the existence of fragments of old mantle broken off from the thick subcontinental lithosphere beneath the Gawler Craton and scattered in the Rodinian break-up rift zone.","1365-246X","","10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03606.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8143097","Seismic tomography;Australia","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","Jan. 2008","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Recently, it was discovered that liquid crystal droplets, in particular conditions, can be driven in desired locations following electric field lines. The pyroelectric properties of the periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal are exploited and PPLN crystal is used as substrate. In fact, heating and/or cooling this material, it has already been demonstrated that surface charges can appear, by pyroelectric effect, leading to very interesting phenomena. Then, being a polar LC molecule, it undergoes a force due to the existing fields, able to move the material. Results show that fragmented droplets coalesce to form bigger droplets in fixed locations, on a longer time scale. In some cases, one single drop can be observed onto each hexagonal domain. These drops behave as microlenses and the whole sample could be viewed as a dynamical optical micro-element able to switch from a diffuser state (fragmentation state) to a microlens array (coalescence state), without the need of an external voltage. Moreover, the birefringent properties of liquid crystals can make such microlenses also tunable.","","978-1-4799-0594-2","10.1109/CLEOE-IQEC.2013.6801000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6801000","","Liquid crystals;Substrates;Lithium niobate;Optical modulation;Lithography;Magnetic properties","","","","3","IEEE","21 Apr 2014","12-16 May 2013","12-16 May 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Certain slope morphologies hint at a possible coseismic development, though further analyses are required to better comprehend their failure history, such as modelling the slope in its pre-failure state and failure development in static and dynamic conditions. To this effect, a geophysical characterization of the landslide body is crucial to estimate the possible failure history of the slope. The Balta rockslide analysed in this paper is located in the seismic region of Vrancea-Buzau, Romanian Carpathian Mountains and presents a deep detachment scarp as well as a massive body of landslide deposits. We applied several geophysical techniques on the landslide body, as well as on the mountain crest above the detachment scarp, in order to characterize the fractured rock material as well as the dimension of failure. Electrical resistivity measurements revealed a possible trend of increasing fragmentation of rockslide material towards the valley bottom, accompanied by increasing soil moisture. Several seismic refraction surveys were performed on the deposits and analysed in form of P-wave refraction tomographies as well as surface waves, allowing to quantify elastic parameters of rock. In addition, a seismic array was installed close to the detachment scarp to analyse the surface wave dispersion properties from seismic ambient noise; the latter was analysed together with a colocated active surface wave analysis survey. Single-station ambient noise measurements completed all over the slope and deposits were used to further reveal impedance contrasts of the fragmented material over in situ rock, representing an important parameter to estimate the depth of the shearing horizon at several locations of the study area. The combined methods allowed the detection of a profound contrast of 70–90 m, supposedly associated with the maximum landslide material thickness. The entirety of geophysical results was used as basis to build up a geomodel of the rockslide, allowing to estimate the geometry and volume of the failed mass, that is, approximately 28.5–33.5 million m3.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9434299","Geomorphology;Seismic tomography;Seismic noise;Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT);Earthquake hazards","","","","","","","18 May 2021","Dec. 2020","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Thus an improved regularity extraction algorithm is proposed in the paper. By using heuristic approach, the algorithm reduces the number of intermediate sub-graphs and isomorphic graphs to be judged effectively, and solves the problem of high repeated sub-graphs and untargeted graph isomorphism.

Through systematic characterization of microwave output dynamics, we reveal an inverse correlation between DC bias voltage (2-6 kV) and conversion efficiency. Concurrently, higher modulation frequencies (e.g., 1.35 GHz) fragment laser energy into denser pulse clusters (27 pulses vs. 14 at 0.7 GHz), reducing energy per pulse and degrading efficiency by nearly 50%. Critically, elevating laser energy to 3.5 mJ at 6 kV reverses this trend, boosting normalized efficiency to 87.68% by mitigating carrier starvation in high-field, non-saturated regimes. These findings underscore that synergistic optimization of vanadium/nitrogen co-doping ratios and pulse cluster design enables the efficiency recovery, while minimizing thermal loads.

Additionally, two localized, isotopically anomalous areas, at 13–15°E and 39–41°E, are characterized by distinctly low negative and high positive ΔεHf values, respectively. The low ΔεHf MORB from 13 to 15°E appear to reflect contamination by HIMU-type mantle from the nearby Bouvet mantle plume, whereas the trace element and isotopic compositions of MORB from 39 to 41°E are most consistent with contamination by metasomatized Archean continental lithospheric mantle. Relatively small source-melt fractionation of Lu/Hf relative to Sm/Nd, compared with MORB from faster-spreading ridges, argues against a significant role for garnet pyroxenite in the generation of most central SWIR MORB. Correlations between ΔεHf and Sr and Pb isotopic and trace element ratios clearly delineate a high-ΔεHf ‘Indian Ocean mantle component’ that can explain the isotope composition of most Indian Ocean MORB as mixtures between this component and a heterogeneous Atlantic–Pacific-type MORB source. The Hf, Nd and Sr isotope compositions of Indian Ocean MORB appear to be most consistent with the hypothesis that this component represents fragments of subduction-modified lithospheric mantle beneath Proterozoic orogenic belts that foundered into the nascent Indian Ocean upper mantle during the Mesozoic breakup of Gondwana.","1460-2415","","10.1093/petrology/egi060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8149006","mid-ocean ridge basalt;isotopes;incompatible elements;Indian Ocean","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","Dec. 2005","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, this proposed language is based on XML Schema, which is relatively inexpressive and suffers from a lack of formal semantics. In this paper, we provide a semantic representation of WSPL in the description logic fragment species of the Web Ontology Language (OWL-DL). OWL-DL will provide the semantic support for the policy description of WSPL, and enhance the expressivity and computability of the policy language. By representing WSPL policies as OWL-DL complex classes that are built up through OWL-DL class expressions, the most standard OWL-DL reasoners can be used to check policy conformance and perform an array of policy analysis tasks through TBox reasoning.","","1-4244-0462-2","10.1109/CHINACOM.2006.344896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4149861","","Web services;Quality of service;Logic;OWL;XML;Information security;Ontologies;Intelligent networks;Laboratories;Telecommunication switching","","","","8","IEEE","10 Apr 2007","25-27 Oct. 2006","25-27 Oct. 2006","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This allows us to trace nanotube array morphological changes under applied voltage (up to 50 V). Specific manipulation with nanotube assemblies was found to be possible under applied electrical field: attachment of a tiny nanotube bundle to the W needle and extraction of a given nanotube fragment from an entangled complex bunch were achieved. The electrically-probed B/N-doped C nanotubes exhibited alternating B-rich and C-rich B-C-N domains within tubular layers, as revealed by elemental mapping during energy-filtered TEM (Omega filter). At room temperature the nanostructures displayed resistivity (ρ) of ∼1.8 × 10−5 Ωm and linear I–V curves.

Recently there has been growing interest in investigating diatomic molecules in intense fields. Although our ideas have matured considerably over the past five or six years, we are just beginning to put together a coherent picture of dissociative ionization.

To that end, we have employed our 4/spl Pi/ electron-ion image spectrometer to study the dissociative ionization spectra of diatomic systems.","","1-55752-444-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=865830","","Ionization;Electrons;Protons;Polarization;Resonance;Physics;Spectroscopy;Hydrogen;Energy states;Platinum","","","","9","","6 Aug 2002","7-7 June 1996","7-7 June 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sensitive high-resolution images reveal hierarchical fragmentation in dense molecular gas from the ∼1 pc clump scale down to ∼0.01 pc condensation scale. At each scale, the mass of the fragments is orders of magnitude larger than the Jeans mass. This is common to all four IRDC clumps we studied, suggesting that turbulence plays an important role in the early stages of clustered star formation. Masers, shock heated NH3 gas, and outflows indicate intense ongoing star formation in some cores while no such signatures are found in others. Furthermore, chemical differentiation may reflect the difference in evolutionary stages among these star formation seeds. We find NH3 ortho/para ratios of 1.1 ± 0.4, 2.0 ± 0.4, and 3.0 ± 0.7 associated with three outflows, and the ratio tends to increase along the outflows downstream.

The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3D data arrays which we call ""groups."" Collaborative Altering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3D transformation. The result is a 3D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2007.901238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271520","Adaptive grouping;block matching;image denoising;sparsity;3-D transform shrinkage","Image denoising;Collaboration;Filtering;Noise reduction;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Energy resolution;Spatial resolution;Signal resolution;Discrete cosine transforms","Algorithms;Artifacts;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","7595","90","23","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the simplest form the problem of gene rearrangements corresponds to sorting by reversals, i.e. sorting of an array using reversals of arbitrary fragments. Kececioglu and Sankoff gave the first approximation algorithm for sorting by reversals with guaranteed error bound and identified open problems related to chromosome rearrangements. One of these problems is Gollan's conjecture on the reversal diameter of the symmetric group. We prove this conjecture and further study the problem of expected reversal distance between two random permutations. We demonstrate that the expected reversal distance is very close to the reversal diameter thereby indicating that reversal distance provides a good separation between related and non-related sequences. The gene rearrangement problem forces us to consider reversals of signed permutations, as the genes in DNA are oriented. Our approximation algorithm for signed permutation provides a 'performance guarantee' of 3/2. Finally, we devise an approximation algorithm for sorting by reversals with a performance ratio of 7/4.<>","","0-8186-4370-6","10.1109/SFCS.1993.366872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=366872","","Genomics;Bioinformatics;Sorting;Sequences;Evolution (biology);Computer science;Biology;Genetic mutations;Approximation algorithms;DNA","","55","","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","3-5 Nov. 1993","3-5 Nov. 1993","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we address the problem of clone detection applied to plagiarism detection in the context of source code assignments done by computer science students. Plagiarism detection comes with a distinct set of constraints to usual clone detection approaches, which influenced the design of the approach we present in this paper. For instance, the source code can be heavily changed at a superficial level (in an attempt to look genuine), yet be functionally very similar. Since assignments turned in by computer science students can be in a variety of languages, we work at the syntactic level and do not consider the source-code semantics. Consequently, the approach we propose is endogenous and makes no assumption about the programming language being analysed. It is based on an alignment method using the parallel principle at local resolution (character level) to compute similarities between documents. We tested our framework on hundreds of real source files, involving a wide array of programming languages (Java, C, Python, PHP, Haskell, bash). Our approach allowed us to discover previously undetected frauds, and to empirically evaluate its accuracy and robustness.","","978-1-4244-8655-7","10.1109/SCAM.2010.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601829","Endogenous;Plagiarism Detection;Similarity Measure;Distance;Source Code Segmentation;Source Code Plagiarism","Cloning;Plagiarism;Computer languages;Context;Robustness;Software systems","","38","","24","IEEE","14 Oct 2010","12-13 Sept. 2010","12-13 Sept. 2010","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigate the possibility of effectively attacking EMG-based identification models with adversarial biological input via a novel EMG signal individual-style transformer based on a generative adversarial network and tiny leaked data segments. Since two same EMG segments do not exist in nature; the leaked data can’t be used to attack the model directly or it will be easily detected. Therefore, it is necessary to extract the style with the leaked personal signals and generate the attack signals with different contents. With our proposed method and tiny leaked personal EMG fragments, numerous EMG signals with different content can be generated in that person’s style. EMG hand gesture data from eighteen subjects and three well-recognized deep EMG classifiers were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack methods. The proposed methods achieved an average of 99.41% success rate on confusing identification models and an average of 91.51% success rate on manipulating identification models. These results demonstrate that EMG classifiers based on deep neural networks can be vulnerable to synthetic data attacks.

All applications are based on the release of an appreciable amount of energy in matter within a very short time interval. Large area thin films are produced on organic foils to improve the water vapor barrier with the help of pulsed electron beam ablation using arrays of channel spark devices. We use large area (>1000 cm/sup 2/), medium energy (<150 keV) pulsed electron beams of up to 40 /spl mu/s pulse duration for surface treatment in combination with deposition techniques to create corrosion and wear resistant surface layers. Other applications utilize the direct pulsed energy release of the high voltage discharge in matter. A cost effective process for the production of large quantities of nanopowder is the explosive electrical discharge through a thin wire. Pulsed discharges in solid materials can lead to fragmentation. This techniques is used in various configurations to fragment concrete as well as electrical appliances for recycling and to grind glass, minerals, etc.","","0-7803-4213-5","10.1109/PPC.1997.679265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=679265","","Voltage;Electron beams;Surface discharges;Surface treatment;Research and development;Thin film devices;Sparks;Corrosion;Resistance;Costs","","5","2","4","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","29 June-2 July 1997","29 June-2 July 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from the traditional disk array, the amount of data allocated on heterogenous peers may be not the same. To maximize the reliability of stored data objects in heterogeneous networks, the optimal allocation of erasure-coded fragments is a challenging problem constrained with heterogeneous peer availabilities and redundancy overhead. This paper examines this optimal problem considered MDS erasure codes applied into distributed storage networks. First, we model the reliability of an allocation with the weighted-k-out-of-s model and extend its properties to efficiently calculate the reliability of an allocation; then we reduce the reliability computation of a given allocation to linear computation cost based on the weighted k-out-of-s model. Then, we deduce the problem to integer partition problem and propose two order-based search algorithms. Our experiments show that our proposed algorithms can be applied to find the optimal allocations efficiently in various practical coding cases. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our proposed search algorithms with some practical storage settings, and then present experimental results including the reliability, redundancy overheads and allocation pattern for the optimal allocation driven by practical network traces.","2374-9628","978-1-4673-4883-6","10.1109/PCCC.2012.6407765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407765","","Resource management;Reliability theory;Availability;Computational modeling;Redundancy;Computer network reliability","","5","1","32","IEEE","10 Jan 2013","1-3 Dec. 2012","1-3 Dec. 2012","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nanopore sequencers measure the change in the electrical current when nucleotide bases translocate through a protein nanopore. These signal level changes are utilized in various nanopore data analysis workflows (such as identifying DNA methylation, polishing and variant detection) to obtain useful results from nanopore sequencing data. Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a dynamic programming algorithm that is used as a key component in many nanopore data analysis workflows. Prior investigations have shown that ABEA consumes 70% of total CPU time in Nanopolish, a popular nanopore data analysis software package. Thus, optimizing the ABEA algorithm is vital for efficient nanopore data analysis. A previous study has proposed an accelerated version of ABEA on GPUs using CUDA that improves the execution time, at the cost of higher energy consumption. With the advancements of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are becoming more and more popular as accelerators that are energy efficient. In this work, we explore the use of the OpenCL for accelerating ABEA on FPGA with energy considerations. We propose a modified version of ABEA for FPGAs using OpenCL and apply various optimization techniques, leading to a few different implementations. We compare the performance of our implementations with other implementations on different hardware platforms in terms of execution time and energy consumption. We show that our best implementation archives an energy consumption of only 43% of the previous implementation of ABEA on GPU, however, with around 4x increase in execution time.

As demand for increased data transfer and new technologies increases, novel research must be performed to combine the benefits of both technologies. In this case, optical communication technologies serve as the backbone of wireless technology. Currently, only a few studies have been conducted on Free Space Optical (FSO) communication employing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and VerticalCavity SurfaceEmitting Lasers (VCSELs). When VCSEL is paired in conjunction with FPGA, there are only very few existing designs. These published researches cover many subjects yet are exceedingly complex and fragmented. The principal purpose of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to identify the research trends and emerging themes in the development of FPGA-based Optical Hybrid Fiber - FSO Communication Systems. This review incorporates articles from prestigious journals that were indexed in scientific databases such as Science Direct, Shodh Ganga, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Scopus. This SLR exhibits the reliability and compatibility of FPGA-based FSOs when used with a lowcost optical source VerticalCavity SurfaceEmitting Laser Diode VCSEL), a range of technologies, communication methods, and approaches. This FPGA-based FSO is designed for optical communication applications that require highly secure transmission schemes, low radiation noise, a low bit error rate (BER), and increased data transfer rates. Additionally, VCSEL has a current threshold that is low, maximum conversion efficiency of power, and least consumption of power. Findings of this study can be used to direct future research in the area of hybrid Fiber-FSO optical communication systems development utilizing VCSEL and FPGA.","2644-1802","978-1-6654-8094-9","10.1109/ICDCS54290.2022.9780848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9780848","FPGA;FSO;VCSEL;OFDM;DWDM;BER;OSNR;OF;OCS","Optical fibers;Wireless communication;Optical fiber communication;Adaptive optics;Optical fiber devices;Reliability;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","","3","","41","IEEE","30 May 2022","21-22 April 2022","21-22 April 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The high dependency on data makes it difficult for them to generalize to a broader chemical space. To address this issue, we introduce the property-aware molecular GNN approach, which, grounded in domain knowledge of chemistry, fragments molecules into motifs and then quantizes the motifs feature vectors through our proposed Discrete Motif Message Passing (DMMP) framework. This extends the representational space of motifs and enhances their generalizability. Moreover, to make the entire molecular graph aware of good motifs features, we construct an augmented molecular graph and design three levels of pretraining tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed multilevel self-supervised pre-training of augmented molecular graph representation learning (MSPmol) outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in molecular property prediction and drug-target affinity (DTA) tasks while providing reasonable chemical interpretations.

The standard practice of deciding formulas of such theories in the hardware industry is either SAT- (using bit-blasting) or SMT-based methods. These methods perform reasoning on a low level but perform it very efficiently. To find alternative potentially promising model checking and equivalence checking methods, a natural idea is to lift reasoning from the bit and bit-vector levels to higher levels. In such an attempt, in [14] we proposed translating memory designs into the Effectively PRopositional (EPR) fragment of first-order logic. The first experiments with using such a translation have been encouraging but raised some questions. Since the high-level encoding we used was incomplete (yet avoiding bit-blasting) some equivalences could not be proved. Another problem was that there was no natural correspondence between models of EPR formulas and bit-vector based models that would demonstrate non-equivalence and hence design errors. This paper addresses these problems by providing more refined translations of equivalence checking problems arising from hardware verification into EPR formulas. We provide three such translations and formulate their properties. All three translations are designed in such a way that models of EPR problems can be translated into bit-vector models demonstrating non-equivalence. We also evaluate the best EPR solvers on industrial equivalence checking problems and compare them with SMT solvers designed and tuned for such formulas specifically. We present empirical evidence demonstrating that EPR-based methods and solvers are competitive.","","978-0-9835678-0-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770942","","Encoding;Cognition;Hardware;Indexes;Clocks;Calculus;Analytical models","","1","","24","","19 May 2011","20-23 Oct. 2010","20-23 Oct. 2010","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An automatic and robust tool is needed to classify the file samples quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the human immune system, we developed a local concentration based virus detection method, which connects a certain number of two-element local concentration vectors as a feature vector. In contrast to the existing data mining techniques, the new method does not remember exact file content for virus detection, but uses a non-signature paradigm, such that it can detect some previously unknown viruses and overcome the techniques like obfuscation to bypass signatures. This model first extracts the viral tendency of each fragment and identifies a set of statical structural detectors, and then uses an information-theoretic preprocessing to remove redundancy in the detectors' set to generate ‘self’ and ‘nonself’ detector libraries. Finally, ‘self’ and ‘nonself’ local concentrations are constructed by using the libraries, to form a vector with an array of two elements of local concentrations for detecting viruses efficiently. Several standard data mining classifiers, including $K$-nearest neighbor (KNN), radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, and support vector machine (SVM), are leveraged to classify the local concentration vector as the feature of a benign or malicious program and to verify the effectiveness and robustness of this approach. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only has a much faster speed, but also gives around 98% of accuracy.","1869-196X","","10.1631/jzus.C1000445","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:60673020,60875080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11285752","Local concentration;Artificial immune system;Virus detection","Support vector machines;Training;Computer viruses;Detectors;Feature extraction;Vectors;Robustness;Libraries;Data mining;Viruses (medical)","","1","","16","","16 Dec 2025","June 2011","","ZUP","ZUP Journals"

A young stellar population is identified all over the observed field, which is found to be distributed in embedded clusters that are surrounded by a distributed halo population extending over a larger projected area. The Spitzer/IRAC data are used to compute a spectral index value, α, for each young stellar object in the field. We use these data to separate pure photospheres from disc excess sources. We find a small fraction of sources with α in excess of 2 to 3 (plus a handful with α∼ 4), which is much higher than the values found in the low-mass star-forming region IC 348 (α≤ 2). The sources with high values of α spatially coincide with the densest regions of the filaments and also with the sites of massive star formation. Star formation is found to be occurring in long filaments stretching to few parsecs that are fragmented over a scale of ∼1 pc. The spatial distribution of young stars are found to be correlated with the filamentary nebulae that are prominently revealed by 8- and 850-μm observations.

The detailed gas dynamics within these pillars can now be compared with observations. Our goal is to quantify the gas dynamics in a pillar being sculpted by a nearby massive star. To do this, we use the CO, 13CO and C18O J = 1–0 emission towards a pillar in the Vulpecula Rift. These data are a combination of Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy and Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory observations providing high-resolution (∼5) imaging of large-scale pillar structures (>100 arcsec). We find that this cold (∼18 K), low-density (8 × 103 cm−3) material is fragmenting on Jeans scales, has very low velocity dispersions (∼0.5 km s−1), and appears to be moving away from the ionizing source. We are able to draw direct comparisons with three models from the literature, and find that those with lower velocity dispersions best fit our data, although the dynamics of any one model do not completely agree with our observations. We do, however, find that our observed pillar exhibits many of the characteristics expected from simulations.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8209286","ISM: clouds;ISM: kinematics and dynamics;ISM: structure;submillimetre: ISM","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","April 2014","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We then use Monte Carlo radiative transfer to generate synthetic Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) images of these self-gravitating discs to determine the subset of this parameter space in which they generate non-axisymmetric structure that is potentially detectable by ALMA. Recently, several transition discs have been observed to have non-axisymmetric structure that extends out to large radii. It has been suggested that one possible origin of these asymmetries could be spiral density waves induced by disc self-gravity. We use our simple model to see if these discs exist in the region of parameter space where self-gravity could feasibly explain these spiral features. We find that for self-gravity to play a role in these systems typically requires a disc mass around an order of magnitude higher than the observed disc masses for the systems. The spiral amplitudes produced by self-gravity in the local approximation are relatively weak when compared to amplitudes produced by tidal interactions, or spirals launched at Lindblad resonances due to embedded planets in the disc. As such, we ultimately caution against diagnosing spiral features as being due to self-gravity, unless the disc exists in the very narrow region of parameter space where the spiral wave amplitudes are large enough to produce detectable features, but not so large as to cause the disc to fragment.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stw296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8153669","radiative transfer;planets and satellites: formation;protoplanetary discs;stars: pre-main-sequence","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","March 2016","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"The haloes of planetary nebulae in the mid-infrared: evidence for interaction with the interstellar medium","G. Ramos-Larios; J. P. Phillips",NA; NA,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,"19 Jan 2018","2009","400","2","575","588","The motion of planetary nebulae through the interstellar medium (ISM) is thought to lead to a variety of observational consequences, including the formation of bright rims, deformation and fragmentation of the shells, and a shift of the central stars away from the geometric centres of the envelopes. These and other characteristics have been noted through imaging in the visual wavelength regime. We report further observations of such shells taken in the mid-infrared (MIR), acquired through programmes of Infrared Array Camera imaging undertaken using the SpitzerSpace Telescope. NGC 2440 and NGC 6629 are shown to possess likely interacting haloes, together with ram-pressure-stripped material to one side of their shells. Similarly, the outer haloes of NGC 3242 and NGC 6772 appear to have been fragmented through Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instabilities, leading to a possible flow of ISM material towards the inner portions of their envelopes. If this interpretation is correct, then it would suggest that NGC 3242 is moving towards the NE, a suggestion which is also supported through the presence of a 60 μm tail extending in the opposite direction, and curved bands of Hα emission in the direction of motion – components which may arise through RT instabilities in the magnetized ISM.NGC 2438 possesses strong scalloping at the outer limits of its asymptotic giant branch (AGB) halo, probably reflecting RT instabilities at the nebular/ISM interface We also note that the interior structure of the source has been interpreted in terms of a recombining shell, a hypothesis which may not be consistent with the central star luminosities.Finally, we point out that two of the rims (and likely shock interfaces) appear to have a distinct signature in the MIR, whereby relative levels of 8.0 μm emission are reduced. This may imply that the grain emission agents are depleted in the post-shock AGB regimes.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15485.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8223219","instabilities;magnetic fields;ISM: jets and outflows;planetary nebulae;infrared: ISM","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","Dec. 2009","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The frequency range of observations, 330–345 GHz, includes the CO(J = 3→2) line emission. CRL 618 and OH 231.8+4.2 show quadrupolar and bipolar optical lobes, respectively, surrounded by a dusty envelope reminiscent of their asymptotic giant branch phase. We report a detection of dust continuum polarized emission in both PPNe above 4σ but no molecular line polarization detection above a 3σ limit. OH 231.8+4.2 is slightly more polarized on average than CRL 618 with a mean fractional polarization of 4.3 and 0.3 per cent, respectively. This agrees with the previous finding that silicate dust shows higher polarization than carbonaceous dust. In both objects, an anticorrelation between the fractional polarization and the intensity is observed. Neither PPNe shows a well-defined toroidal equatorial field, rather the field is generally well aligned and organized along the polar direction. This is clearly seen in CRL 618 while in the case of OH 231.8+4.2, the geometry indicates an X-shaped structure coinciding overall with a dipole/polar configuration. However in the later case, the presence of a fragmented and weak toroidal field should not be discarded. Finally, in both PPNe, we observed that the well-organized magnetic field is parallel with the major axis of the 12CO outflow. This alignment could indicate the presence of a magnetic outflow launching mechanism. Based on our new high-resolution data we propose two scenarios to explain the evolution of the magnetic field in evolved stars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stt2318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8183758","magnetic fields;polarization;stars: AGB and post-AGB;stars individual: CRL 618;stars individual: OH 231.8+4.2","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","Feb. 2014","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Conventional consumer behavior models, on the other hand, rely on fragmented data sources and analytical tools that may not reflect the current post-pandemic consumption patterns. Such models are also incapable of incorporating multiple data types and can also fail to address changing social factors. In response, a Multi-Modal Consumer Behavior Prediction Framework (MCBP) that considers a vast array of data sources is introduced. BERT and GNNs are used to give a detailed, real-time interpretation of consumer behaviour accomplished by the MCBP framework. It uses BERT to extract and analyze sentiment and topics of the textual data and GNNs to capture influence and peer effects on purchase decisions. The findings of the study show the effectiveness of the proposed framework with an accuracy of 99%. 5% and the implementation is done using Python.

Spitzer Infrared Array Camera ratio maps reveal that the bubble is traced by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission following an almost circular morphology except in the south-west direction towards the low molecular density environment. The observational signatures of the collected molecular and cold dust material have been found around the bubble. We have detected 418 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the selected region around the bubble N14. Interestingly, the detected YSO clusters are associated with the collected molecular and cold dust material at the borders of the bubble. One of the clusters is found with deeply embedded intermediate mass and massive Class I YSOs associated with one of the dense dust clumps in the east of the bubble N14. We do not find good agreement between the dynamical age of the H II region and the fragmentation time of the accumulated molecular materials to explain the possible ‘collect-and-collapse’ process around the bubble N14. Therefore, we suggest the possibility of triggered star formation by compression of the pre-existing dense clumps by the shock wave and/or small-scale Jeans gravitational instabilities in the collected materials. We have also investigated 5 young massive embedded protostars (8–10 M⊙) and 15 intermediate mass (3–7 M⊙) Class I YSOs which are associated with the dust and molecular fragmented clumps at the borders of the bubble. We conclude that the expansion of the H II region is also leading to the formation of these intermediate and massive Class I YSOs around the bubble N14.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/sts430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8180603","stars: formation;stars: pre-main-sequence;ISM: bubbles;dust, extinction;H II regions;ISM: individual objects (IRAS 18134−1652)","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","Feb. 2013","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The extant radio observations and X-ray data which we have independently re-reduced, together with new optical spectroscopy of the large-scale fragmented nebulosity, confirm the identification. Optical spectra, taken across five different, widely separated nebula regions of the remnant as seen in the Hα images, show average ratios of [N ii]/Hα= 2.42, [S ii]/Hα= 2.10 and [S ii] 6717/6731 = 1.23, as well as strong [O i] 6300, 6364 Å and [O ii] 3727 Å emission. These ratios are firmly 3within those typical of SNRs.Here, we also present the radio-continuum detection of the SNR at 20/13 cm from observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).

These fragmented setups often involve separate controllers for power sequencing, JTAG probing, clock programming, and firmware loading, which increases validation time, complexity, and the likelihood of interface mismatches. Moreover, the lack of runtime reconfigurability and signal level observability limits early-stage silicon bring-up, especially when multiple voltage rails and interface standards are involved. To address these challenges, an FPGA-based validation framework is proposed that unifies multiple validation paths through a compact and reconfigurable setup. Power rail sequencing and voltage setup is achieved by configuring a single I2C slave PMIC to drive multiple outputs, enabling full power-up validation across SoC domains. On-chip temperature sensing and current monitoring are also integrated for health checks. Multiple JTAG and boundary scan interfaces present on the SoC are accessed through a common FPGA-controlled JTAG interface, enabling ATPG, BIST, and debug module validation without requiring separate hardware connections. Clock sources across the SoC are configured dynamically using two-wire I2C or SPI lines to programmable oscillators, allowing flexible frequency programming without external tools. Reset lines are controlled through programmable logic, supporting glitch injection, sequencing, and controlled de-assertion for robust startup validation. Firmware loading is accomplished over Ethernet, while debug visibility is provided through integrated logic analyzers and UART-based logging-eliminating the need for software driven utilities. By consolidating all validation stages-from power integrity to protocol and debug analysis-into a single FPGA-controlled environment, the framework enables high observability, reduces hardware dependency, and supports full automation. Leakage and operational current profiling, trace capture, and firmware execution tracking are seamlessly handled through minimal signal routing. This approach significantly reduces the need for protocol converters and debug utilities, offering a scalable and efficient solution for validating modern SoC designs in both engineering and production environments.","2833-8391","979-8-3315-0129-7","10.1109/ITCIndia66078.2025.11141583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11141583","FPGA;post-silicon validation;System-on-Chip (SoC);standalone test framework;debug infrastructure","Temperature sensors;Sequential analysis;Voltage;Hardware;Software;System-on-chip;Sensors;Logic;Observability;Microprogramming","","","","15","IEEE","2 Sep 2025","20-22 July 2025","20-22 July 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For 3C 34, we report a spectral flattening in the region of the central filament, suggesting that the origin of the filaments is related to the presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields. We also report periodic total intensity and spectral index banding of diffuse emission in the eastern lobe, seen for the first time in radio galaxy lobes. The hotspot complexes are resolved into multiple fragments of varying structure and spectral index; we discuss the implications for particle acceleration and jet termination models.

An ever expanding set of sophisticated application services will take advantage of the QoS-enabled connectivity infrastructure of next-generation networks. These application services, their variety, their ease of use through a large variety of intelligent enduser devices, and their convergence and interworking across multiple domains will constitute the hallmarks of success in the next-generation service universe. Rudimentary forms of some of these application services are already deployed over the Internet. They range from communication services (e.g., VoIP, video, IM, email), to entertainment services that involve content delivery (e.g., music on demand, low to medium quality video on demand, gaming), to a vast array of data and information services (browsing, searching, e-commerce, information retrieval, software distribution, etc.). Since the Internet currently is not QoS-enabled, these services are typically offered on a best effort basis, often with inconsistent or unpredictable quality and fragmented end-user experience. Furthermore, most applications today have a ""stovepipe"" nature; that is, they are offered independent of one another, each typically with its own user interface and other ancillary features like authentication, charging, and session management. This paradigm will begin to change in next-generation networks, first by enabling the applications to use the QoS capabilities of the underlying connectivity infrastructure to provide a consistently high-quality user experience. More significantly, however, applications will progressively lose their stovepipe nature to become increasingly more intertwined and composite, thereby becoming far more attractive and useful to the end user. This convergence, mash-up, blending, composition, and brokering of application services, and the reusable components or enablers that form the foundational building blocks for their realization across the domains of communication (IMS), entertainment (IPTV), information (web), and others, will constitute a defining, as well as differentiating, attribute of service architecture in next-generation networks.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2012.6163577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6163577","","Special issues and sections;Next generation networking;IP networks;Quality of service;Convergence;Wireless communication;IPTV;Internet;Context aware services;Multimedia communication","","4","","","IEEE","5 Mar 2012","March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is proposed that this self-serve model of a data service will allow local, regional, and continental based environmental and ecological modelling and monitoring to proliferate beyond previous limitations and effectively address pressing global issues such as language, cultural, and biodiversity loss.","","978-1-6654-9960-6","10.1109/IDSTA55301.2022.9923039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9923039","","","","","","","IEEE","20 Oct 2022","5-7 Sept. 2022","5-7 Sept. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
