**Subject**: Permission Request for Academic Book - Fragmented Aperture Antennas

Dear Dr. Ellgardt and Dr. Persson,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your permission to use figures from your 2006 EuCAP paper, "Characteristics of a broad-band wide-scan fragmented aperture phased array antenna."

**About Me and My Project:**

I am Dr. James G. Maloney, the original inventor of Fragmented Aperture Antennas (U.S. Patent 6,323,809, granted November 2001). I am currently writing a comprehensive book on this technology, titled *Fragmented Aperture Antennas*, which will be the definitive reference on computational antenna design using genetic algorithms and pixelated apertures.

**Why Your Work Matters to My Book:**

Your 2006 paper represents crucial independent validation of the fragmented aperture concept by the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI). Your successful implementation of a broad-band, wide-scan fragmented aperture array demonstrates that this approach works across different research groups and applications. This external validation is essential for establishing the credibility and broad applicability of the technique.

**Specific Figures Requested:**

I would like to include the following two figures from your paper:

1. **Antenna photograph** (showing the fabricated fragmented aperture array)
   - **Purpose**: This figure would appear in Chapter 3 (Improved Approach to Design Fragmented Apertures), where I discuss fabrication challenges encountered in early fragmented aperture designs, specifically the "diagonal touching" issue where pixels touch only at corners
   - **Why critical**: This is noted in my manuscript as a key figure needed to illustrate physical implementations by external research groups

2. **Performance measurement** (VSWR vs frequency/scan angle, or gain measurements)
   - **Purpose**: Chapter 2 (Original Approach) to demonstrate wide-scan performance achieved by your design
   - **Context**: Shows quantitative validation of the fragmented aperture approach for wide-scan arrays

**How Your Work Will Be Credited:**

- Full citation in the bibliography using IEEE format
- Figure captions explicitly crediting you and your publication
- Text discussion acknowledging FOI's independent development
- Proper copyright attribution as you direct

**Why I'm Contacting You Directly:**

I initially approached IEEE for permission, but they quoted $86 USD for two figures. As this is an academic book project documenting the history and development of fragmented aperture technology, I wanted to reach out to you directly to see if you would be willing to grant permission for academic use. Many researchers prefer direct collaboration for scholarly works, and I believe this approach better serves the academic community.

**What I Need from You:**

1. **Written permission** to use the two figures specified above (this email exchange can serve as formal documentation)
2. **High-resolution versions** of the figures, if available (original publication quality or higher)
3. **Your preferred attribution text** - I want to ensure you are credited exactly as you wish

**Additional Context:**

If you are unable to grant permission directly due to IEEE copyright policies or FOI institutional requirements, I completely understand and will work through official channels. However, if you have the authority to grant this permission or can help facilitate it, I would be deeply grateful.

I should mention that your work will be featured alongside other pioneering research in fragmented apertures, including work by Thors et al. (Sweden), Barani et al. (University of Michigan), Herscovici et al., and recent advances by researchers at Georgia Tech Research Institute.

**Timeline:**

I am hoping to finalize permissions over the next 4-8 weeks. There is no immediate rush, but earlier responses help me plan the book's production schedule.

**Questions?**

If you have any questions about how the figures will be used, the context in which they will appear, or the book project in general, I would be happy to provide additional information or even share the relevant manuscript sections with you.

Thank you very much for considering this request. Your work has made an important contribution to the field of fragmented aperture antennas, and I look forward to featuring it in this book.

3. **Measured vs simulated performance** (Gain, patterns, or VSWR)
   - **Purpose**: Chapter 2 - validates computational design approach
   - **Why important**: Shows excellent model-measurement agreement, validating the FDTD/GA methodology

4. **Optional: Design specifications table or GA parameters**
   - **Purpose**: Comparative analysis of different GA implementations
   - **Why useful**: Helps readers understand design trade-offs

**Subject**: Permission Request for Academic Book - Your 2019 33:1 Bandwidth Work

Dear Dave, Keith, Dan, and GTRI colleagues,

I hope you're all doing well. I'm writing to request your permission to use figures from your 2019 IEEE APS paper, "A Broadband Array with Unbalanced Feeds: Elements and Power Combiners Based on the Fragmented Aperture Principle."

**My Project:**

I'm writing a comprehensive book titled *Fragmented Aperture Antennas* that documents the development, theory, and applications of this technology from the original 2001 patent through current state-of-the-art implementations.

**Why Your 2019 Work Is Critical:**

Your 33:1 bandwidth achievement represents the flagship result in fragmented aperture array technology. This is the most important modern validation of the fragmented aperture principle, demonstrating that:

1. Extraordinary bandwidths (33:1) are achievable
2. The fragmented aperture principle extends to power combiners and feed networks
3. Unbalanced feeds enable ultra-wideband performance

Your work is cited in both Chapter 1 (Introduction) and Chapter 7 (Wideband Arrays), where it serves as the culminating achievement in the progression from the original concept to modern implementations.

**Specific Figures Requested:**

I would like to include 3-4 figures:

1. **Array element design** (showing the ultra-wideband element geometry)
   - Purpose: Chapters 1 and 7 - flagship wideband achievement
   - Shows ultimate bandwidth capability of fragmented approach

2. **Measured 33:1 VSWR performance**
   - Purpose: Chapter 7 - quantitative proof of bandwidth
   - Critical for demonstrating unprecedented performance

3. **Power combiner** (based on fragmented aperture principle)
   - Purpose: Chapter 7 - extension of fragmented concept
   - Shows fragmented principle applies beyond radiating elements

4. **Unbalanced feed structure** (if available)
   - Purpose: Chapter 7 - feed innovation

**Context:**

As you know, I'm no longer at GTRI, which is why I'm reaching out to you individually rather than through official channels. I initially explored IEEE permissions, but they quoted significant fees. Given that this work builds directly on the fragmented aperture technology I invented, and given our collaborative history, I wanted to ask if you would be willing to grant permission for me to use these figures.

**What I Need:**

1. **Your permission** to use the figures (individual author permission)
2. **High-resolution versions** of the figures (if you have access to them)
3. **Confirmation** that you're comfortable granting this without institutional approval

**How You'll Be Credited:**

- Full citation with all authors listed
- Explicit attribution in captions
- Text discussion highlighting GTRI's achievement
- Proper IEEE copyright notice as required

**Understanding if This Is Difficult:**

I completely understand if institutional or intellectual property considerations make this complicated. If you're unable to grant permission directly, I can pursue IEEE formal channels. However, if you're able and willing to help, it would make this book project much more feasible and would ensure your excellent work is prominently featured.

**Timeline:**

Hoping to finalize permissions over next 4-8 weeks, but flexible.

Thanks for considering this. The 33:1 bandwidth work deserves to be showcased as the culmination of fragmented aperture array development, and I hope we can find a way to include it.

Best regards,

Jim Maloney

**Subject**: Permission Request for Academic Book - Your 2024 Topology Optimization Work

Dear Chris,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to request your permission to use figures from your recent 2024 ARRAY paper, "Topology Optimization of a Wideband Planar Phased Array Element Using Periodic Level Set Functions."

**My Project:**

I'm writing a book titled *Fragmented Aperture Antennas* documenting this technology from the original 2001 concept through modern implementations and optimization methods.

**Why Your 2024 Work Matters:**

Chapter 3 of my book covers "Improved Approach to Design Fragmented Apertures," including a new section on modern optimization methods beyond genetic algorithms. Your topology optimization work using level set functions represents important recent progress, demonstrating that:

1. Alternative optimization methods (beyond GA) are effective for fragmented designs
2. Level set methods can produce competitive or improved results
3. GTRI continues to advance the state-of-the-art in fragmented aperture technology

**Specific Figures Requested:**

I would like 2-3 figures:

1. **Topology optimization progression** (showing evolution of design)
   - Purpose: Chapter 3 - illustrates modern optimization method
   - Shows alternative to GA approach

2. **Optimized antenna geometry**
   - Purpose: Chapter 3 - comparison with GA designs
   - Demonstrates topology optimization results

3. **Performance comparison** (if available)
   - Purpose: Chapter 3 - quantifies different optimization approaches

**Context:**

As you may know, I'm no longer at GTRI. I'm reaching out to you directly to see if you'd be willing to grant permission for these figures. IEEE quoted significant fees, and given our collaborative history and the fact that this work builds on technology I invented, I wanted to ask if you might be comfortable granting individual author permission.

**What I Need:**

1. Your permission to use the figures
2. High-res versions (if accessible)
3. Confirmation you're comfortable with this approach

**How You'll Be Credited:**

- Full citation with all authors
- Explicit attribution in captions
- Recognition of GTRI's modern optimization work

**Understanding Institutional Constraints:**

I completely understand if GTRI or IEEE policies make this complicated. If so, I can pursue formal channels. But if you can help, it would be greatly appreciated.

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks, flexible

Thanks for considering this. Your topology optimization work represents the modern evolution of fragmented aperture design methods.

Best regards,

Jim Maloney

**My Project:**

Writing a book on Fragmented Aperture Antennas covering the full development from original concept through modern implementations.

**Why Your Work:**

Your 2017 mmWave work demonstrates fragmented apertures work effectively at higher frequencies, which is important for Chapter 7 (Wideband Arrays). Need 2 figures showing the mmWave antenna and measured performance.

**Context:**

No longer at GTRI, so reaching out directly. IEEE wants fees; hoping you might grant individual permission given our history.

**What I Need:**

1. Permission for 2 figures
2. High-res versions if available
3. Confirmation you're OK with this

**Credit:** Full citation and attribution.

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks

Completely understand if institutional constraints are an issue.
