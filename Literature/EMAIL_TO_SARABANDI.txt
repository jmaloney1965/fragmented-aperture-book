Subject: Permission Request for Academic Book - Your 2018 Fragmented Antenna Work

Dear Prof. Sarabandi,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your permission to use figures from your excellent 2018 IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation paper, "Fragmented Antenna Realization Using Coupled Small Radiating Elements."

**About Me and My Project:**

I am Dr. James G. Maloney, the original inventor of Fragmented Aperture Antennas (U.S. Patent 6,323,809, 2001). I am currently writing a comprehensive book on this technology, titled *Fragmented Aperture Antennas*, which will serve as the definitive reference on computationally designed pixelated antennas.

**Why Your Work Is Important to My Book:**

Your 2018 paper represents important recent innovation in the fragmented aperture field. By developing a fragmented antenna using coupled small radiating elements, you and your team extended the original concept in a creative new direction. Your work demonstrates that:

1. The fragmented aperture philosophy remains relevant and actively researched
2. Modern variations can address different design objectives
3. The University of Michigan research group has successfully adopted and advanced the approach

Your paper is cited in **three chapters** of my book (Introduction, Original Approach, and Improved Approach), providing critical evidence that fragmented aperture technology continues to evolve nearly two decades after the original concept.

**Specific Figures Requested:**

I would like to include the following **three figures** from your paper:

1. **Figure 1**: Proposed fragmented antenna concept showing coupled elements on robotic flyers
   - **Purpose**: Chapter 1 (Introduction) - illustrates modern application and coupled-element concept
   - **Context**: Shows evolution from pixel-based to coupled-element fragmented antennas

2. **Figure 2**: Configuration of inductively end-loaded folded dipole antenna element
   - **Purpose**: Chapters 2 and 3 - shows physical antenna element design
   - **Context**: Demonstrates miniaturized implementation (12×10×10 cm, 18g)

3. **Figure 7**: Performance analysis showing (a) bandwidth and (b) radiation efficiency
   - **Purpose**: Chapters 2 and 3 - quantitative validation of coupled-element approach
   - **Context**: Critical figure showing bandwidth enhancement through coupling

**Why I'm Contacting You Directly:**

I initially approached IEEE for permission, but they quoted $129 USD for three figures. As this is an academic book project documenting the scientific development of fragmented aperture technology, I wanted to reach out directly to see if you would be willing to grant permission for academic use. Given the University of Michigan's strong tradition in antenna research, I hope you might be supportive of this scholarly work.

**How Your Work Will Be Credited:**

- Full citation in the bibliography (IEEE format)
- Figure captions explicitly crediting all authors and IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation
- Text discussion highlighting your innovative coupled-element approach
- Recognition of University of Michigan's contributions to fragmented aperture research
- Proper IEEE copyright attribution as required

**What I Need from You:**

1. **Written permission** to use Figures 1, 2, and 7 (this email exchange can serve as documentation)
2. **High-resolution versions** of the three figures (original publication quality or vector graphics if available)
3. **Your preferred attribution text** - I want to ensure proper credit
4. **Contact info for Navid Barani** (if you're willing to forward this request to him, or provide his current contact - I understand he's now at Meta)

If you are unable to grant permission directly due to IEEE copyright or university policies, I understand and will pursue official channels. However, direct author permission greatly facilitates academic collaboration and would be deeply appreciated.

**Timeline:**

I am hoping to finalize permissions over the next 4-8 weeks, though there is flexibility in the schedule.

Thank you very much for considering this request. Your 2018 paper demonstrates the continuing vitality of fragmented aperture research, and I am pleased to feature it prominently in the book.

Best regards,

Dr. James G. Maloney

**P.S.** - If Dr. Barani has additional results or insights from his dissertation work that you think would enhance the book, I would be interested in learning about them!
