Subject: Permission Request for Academic Book - Your 2006 Fragmented Aperture Work

Dear Dr. Ellgardt and Dr. Persson,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your permission to use figures from your excellent 2006 EuCAP paper, "Characteristics of a Broadband, Wide-Scan Fragmented Aperture Antenna."

**About Me and My Project:**

I am Dr. James G. Maloney, the original inventor of Fragmented Aperture Antennas (U.S. Patent 6,323,809, 2001). I am currently writing a comprehensive book on this technology, titled *Fragmented Aperture Antennas*, which will serve as the definitive reference on computationally designed pixelated antennas.

**Why Your Work Is Important to My Book:**

Your 2006 paper represents critical independent validation of the fragmented aperture concept by the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI). Your research team successfully demonstrated wide-scan capabilities and addressed important fabrication challenges - particularly the diagonal touching issue that arises in certain fragmented antenna designs. Your work is cited in **three chapters** of my book (Introduction, Original Approach, and Improved Approach).

**Specific Figures Requested:**

I would like to include the following **three figures** from your paper:

1. **Figure 1**: The array antenna unit cell (20×20 pixel grid with diagonal feed lines)
   - **Purpose**: Chapters 2 and 3 - shows physical implementation of fragmented aperture concept
   - **Context**: Demonstrates independent validation by FOI Sweden
   - **Critical importance**: Shows the basic geometry that leads to diagonal touching

2. **Figure 5**: The diagonal touching problem and two proposed solutions
   - **Purpose**: Chapter 3 - illustrates a critical fabrication challenge
   - **Context**: This figure directly addresses a known issue in fragmented aperture design
   - **Critical importance**: Best published illustration of diagonal touching issue and solutions

3. **Figure 7**: Performance results showing (a) reflection coefficient and (b) radiation pattern
   - **Purpose**: Chapters 2 and 3 - quantitative validation of wide-scan performance
   - **Context**: Demonstrates successful wide-scan capability of fragmented apertures
   - **Critical importance**: Independent validation from respected European research institution

**Why I'm Contacting You Directly:**

I initially approached IEEE for permission, but they quoted $129 USD for three figures. As this is an academic book project documenting the scientific development of fragmented aperture technology, I wanted to reach out directly to see if you would be willing to grant permission for academic use. Given FOI's strong tradition in antenna research and international collaboration, I hope you might be supportive of this scholarly work.

**How Your Work Will Be Credited:**

- Full citation in the bibliography (IEEE format)
- Figure captions explicitly crediting all authors and the 2006 EuCAP conference
- Text discussion highlighting FOI's contributions to fragmented aperture research
- Recognition of your solution to the diagonal touching problem (Figure 5)
- Proper IEEE copyright attribution as required

**What I Need from You:**

1. **Written permission** to use Figures 1, 5, and 7 (this email exchange can serve as documentation)
2. **High-resolution versions** of the three figures (original publication quality or vector graphics if available)
3. **Your preferred attribution text** - I want to ensure proper credit
4. **Contact information** for your co-authors if they need to be consulted

If you are unable to grant permission directly due to IEEE copyright or FOI institutional policies, I understand and will pursue official channels. However, direct author permission greatly facilitates academic collaboration and would be deeply appreciated.

**Timeline:**

I am hoping to finalize permissions over the next 4-8 weeks, though there is flexibility in the schedule.

Thank you very much for considering this request. Your 2006 paper provides crucial validation of the fragmented aperture concept from an independent research institution, and I am pleased to feature it prominently in the book.

Best regards,

**P.S.** - I am particularly grateful for your Figure 5 analysis of the diagonal touching problem, as it represents the clearest published treatment of this important fabrication issue. If you have additional insights or unpublished data on this topic, I would be very interested in learning about them!
