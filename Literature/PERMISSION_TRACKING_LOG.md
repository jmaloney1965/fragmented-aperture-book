5. ✅ Update tracking: Status = GRANTED
6. ✅ Update RIGHTS_TRACKING_SPREADSHEET.csv
7. ✅ Add to "successful approaches" for future reference

**If NO (cannot grant permission)**:
1. ✅ Thank him for response
2. ✅ Ask if he has suggestions (IEEE process, other contacts)
3. ✅ Update tracking: Status = DENIED
4. ✅ Fall back to IEEE formal request ($129)

**If CONDITIONAL (can grant with conditions)**:

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

**Probability estimates**:
- Grant permission: 70-80% (academic courtesy, you invented the tech)
- Request modifications: 10-15% (e.g., fewer figures, specific attribution)
- Cannot grant (IEEE copyright): 5-10%
- No response: 5-10%

**Most likely outcome**: Permission granted with high-res figures within 7 days
