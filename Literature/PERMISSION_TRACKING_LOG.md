## 📝 Next Papers to Contact

### ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - All Critical External Papers Sent

- [X] **Sarabandi** (UMich) - Barani2018Fragmented - SENT Feb 18
- [X] **Thors et al.** (FOI/AFRL) - Thors2005Broad-band - SENT Feb 18
- [X] **Ellgardt & Persson** (FOI) - Ellgardt2006Characteristics - SENT Feb 18

**Total Potential Savings**: $387 (if all approve)

### Priority 2 (Wait for Response Rate, Then Consider):

**Strategy**: Wait to see response rate from Phase 1 before sending more

- [ ] **Wright et al.** - Wright2018Mems (MEMS reconfigurable for Ch 5)
- [ ] **Landgren** (GTRI) - Landgren2017 & 2019 papers (33:1 bandwidth)
- [ ] **Howard** (GTRI) - Howard2024Topology (topology optimization)
- [ ] **Dykes** (GTRI) - Dykes2017Wideband (mmWave)

**Recommended**: Wait 5-7 days to see Phase 1 response rate before contacting GTRI colleagues

## 💡 Response Handling

### When Sarabandi Responds:

**If YES (grants permission)**:
1. ✅ Thank him profusely
2. ✅ Request high-res figure files
3. ✅ Ask preferred attribution text
4. ✅ Ask if he can forward to Barani or provide contact
5. ✅ Update tracking: Status = GRANTED
6. ✅ Update RIGHTS_TRACKING_SPREADSHEET.csv
7. ✅ Add to "successful approaches" for future reference

**If NO (cannot grant permission)**:
1. ✅ Thank him for response
2. ✅ Ask if he has suggestions (IEEE process, other contacts)
3. ✅ Update tracking: Status = DENIED
4. ✅ Fall back to IEEE formal request ($129)

**If CONDITIONAL (can grant with conditions)**:
1. ✅ Understand conditions
2. ✅ Agree if reasonable
3. ✅ Document conditions for compliance

**If NO RESPONSE by Feb 25**:
1. ✅ Send polite follow-up email
2. ✅ Keep brief: "Just checking if you received my request..."
3. ✅ Wait another 5-7 days
4. ✅ If still no response by March 3, consider IEEE route

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

**Probability estimates**:
- Grant permission: 70-80% (academic courtesy, you invented the tech)
- Request modifications: 10-15% (e.g., fewer figures, specific attribution)
- Cannot grant (IEEE copyright): 5-10%
- No response: 5-10%

**Most likely outcome**: Permission granted with high-res figures within 7 days

## 🔔 Reminders

- [ ] Check email daily for response from Sarabandi
- [ ] Prepare next emails (FOI Sweden) while waiting
- [ ] Don't send too many at once - manage responses
- [ ] Update this log as responses come in
- [ ] Track time from send to response for planning

---

**Last Action**: Sent all 3 Phase 1 emails on Feb 18, 2026 (Sarabandi, Thors, Ellgardt)
**Next Action**: Monitor email for responses; follow up Feb 25-28 if no responses; wait to see response rate before sending Phase 2 (GTRI) emails
