## REVIEW NEEDED - Potentially Less Relevant

### ⚠️ NOT ANTENNA-RELATED (Should Delete)

15. **Martinello 2011** - "Fragmented aperture imaging for motion and defocus deblurring"
    - ❌ **This is about CAMERA optics, not antennas!**
    - Should be **DELETED** from your bibliography

### ⚠️ CHECK RELEVANCE

Papers in the "Pixelated Antennas" search (113 papers) may include:
- Some relevant (pixelated = fragmented concept)
- Some NOT relevant (different pixelation concepts, imaging, etc.)

**Action needed**: Review export...11.39.19.bib carefully

## QUICK REVIEW CHECKLIST

Use this to decide if a paper should stay in your bibliography:

### ✅ KEEP if it:
- [ ] Is about fragmented/pixelated ANTENNAS (not cameras, optics, etc.)
- [ ] Uses fragmented aperture principle for RF/microwave
- [ ] Cites your work or GTRI work
- [ ] Is from a peer institution working on similar concepts
- [ ] Provides foundational theory (GA, FDTD, optimization)
- [ ] Shows applications of fragmented apertures

### ❌ DELETE if it:
- [ ] Is about optical/camera apertures
- [ ] Is about general "fragmentation" (not antenna-specific)
- [ ] Is about pixelated displays or sensors
- [ ] Only mentions "aperture" in passing
- [ ] Is a duplicate entry

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Step 1: Quick Scan (30 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/jim.maloney/Book/Literature/

# Read each .bib file and note titles that seem off-topic
less export2026.02.17-11.37.40.bib  # 18 papers
less export2026.02.17-11.38.27.bib  # 20 papers
less export2026.02.17-11.38.54.bib  # 14 papers
less export2026.02.17-11.39.19.bib  # 113 papers (NEEDS MOST REVIEW)
```

### Step 2: Consolidate (I can help with this)
After you identify keepers, I can:
1. Merge all keeper papers into master_bibliography.bib
2. Organize by chapter relevance
3. Flag papers you should download/read
4. Create per-chapter bibliography files

### Step 3: Download Key PDFs
Priority downloads:
- Thors 2005 (if you don't have it)
- Barani 2018
- Howard 2024
- Wu 2025
- Any other highly-cited papers

## NEXT STEPS

**Tell me which papers you want to keep, and I'll:**
1. ✅ Create chapter-specific .bib files
2. ✅ Download any publicly available PDFs
3. ✅ Generate a citation summary table
4. ✅ Create a "still needed" list for papers behind paywalls

**Your turn:**
- Review the 165 papers (focus on the 113 pixelated antenna ones)
- Mark which ones to delete
- Let me know and I'll clean up the bibliography
