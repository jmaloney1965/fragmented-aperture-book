Predefined, conventional structures are often implemented and optimized through optimization techniques. However, recent trends show that optimized pixelated antennas can outperform classical designs due to greater design flexibility. This study proposes a novel approach towards designing a pixelated antenna with no conventional shape, which could be configured to resonate at any frequency using a genetic algorithm. To achieve this, a radiating structure composed of an 8x8 grid of metallic pixels was generated, with each pixel being independently controlled by a binary parameter. This structure was then mirrored across both the X and Y axes for symmetry. As this was a binary optimization task, a genetic algorithm was used to find the optimal pixel configuration that achieves resonance at a desired frequency while minimizing return loss. The antennas were simulated in CST Microwave Studio while the Genetic Algorithm was run on MATLAB to generate the antenna parameters. The generated structures show excellent performance with return loss (S11) values of −18.05dB at 2.45GHz, −28.93dB at 3GHz, −16.49dB. at 4GHz, −28.78dB at 5GHz, and −22.34dB at 6GHz, respectively.

To design a set of pixilation-based unit cells, a single bit with a binary value of 0 or 1 that indicates the presence or absence of copper at the pixel level, respectively, has been considered for each pixel. By setting the dimensions of each unit cell with a value of 0.4$\lambda\times 0.4\lambda$ ($\lambda$ being the wavelength at 12 GHz) and with binary optimization based on GA, appropriate transmission coefficient with suitable transmission phase in the range of [0,2$\pi$] has been achieved.

Two implementation strategies are introduced. In the first strategy, larger pixels are initially partitioned and samples are collected. A surrogate model is then established using convolutional neural networks (CNN), and an initial shape is derived through particle swarm optimization (PSO). Again, further refinement is achieved by finer pixel partitioning and subsequent CNN-based PSO. The second strategy leverages a pre-existing broadband E-shaped patch design, which is then subdivided into smaller pixels. By collecting samples, training a CNN surrogate model, and performing PSO optimization, a broader bandwidth is realized. Compared with the reported MLA optimization methods, MLAQBM establishes a stable surrogate model that is robust, easy to converge, and adaptable to different optimization objectives.

To overcome this issue, we propose a formulation for the channel capacity of a compact MIMO system that directly links it to the geometry of a pixelated surface embedded into the MIMO system. This formulation allows us to maximize the channel capacity of the MIMO system and straightforwardly obtain the optimum geometry for the pixelated surface that reduces spatial correlation. The key step in obtaining the formulation is to link the pixelated surface geometry to an impedance matrix that allows us to obtain an expression for the systems channel capacity. The formulation is general and can be applied to a wide variety of MIMO antenna systems and geometries. To demonstrate the versatility of the approach, we include a design for a compact 4-port planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) array integrated with a pixelated surface. Simulations and experiments are provided to evaluate the performance of the compact MIMO system with and without optimization of the surface. It is shown that optimizing the geometry of the pixelated surface can increase channel capacity by 13% and energy efficiency by 19.9% compared to the system without optimization. The importance of the approach is that it provides a link between communication and electromagnetic formulations of MIMO antenna systems.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3101687","Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:16209019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9506812","Capacity maximization;compact MIMO;mutual coupling;pixelated surface;spatial correlation","MIMO communication;Channel capacity;Image quality;Antennas;Geometry;Surface impedance;Correlation","","20","","44","IEEE","4 Aug 2021","Sept. 2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each movable patch is a cantilevered plate, micro-fabricated from a Ni layer plated on an RT Duroid substrate. The Ni patch is magnetically actuated by means of an electro-permanent magnet (EPM) placed behind the ground plane of the antenna. Since the Ni patch is itself part of the radiating element, this approach eliminates the need to insert an external switch on the antenna plane. The EPM is placed behind the ground plane, therefore eliminating losses associated with bias lines generally used in pixelated antennas. Most importantly, the very low mechanical contact resistance (as low as 200 mΩ) between the Ni and Cu patch ensures high antenna efficiency. The EPM enables latching of the magnetic actuator, hence resulting in zero static configuration power consumption.

The KLSM reduces the design space dimensionality and transforms the complex discrete pixelated antenna optimization problem into a low-dimensional continuous optimization problem via variable substitution. Second, a dual surrogate-assisted genetic algorithm (DSGA) is proposed to solve the KLSM-based antenna optimization problem. The DSGA employs two surrogate-assisted strategies to improve the traditional genetic algorithm.

To achieve these, we rely on the optimization of a discretized surface, which can implement near-arbitrary antenna shapes. However, performing an electromagnetic (EM) optimization with a large number of variables is prohibitively costly. On the other hand, if EM simulations can be replaced by a machine learning (ML) based approach, antenna optimization could be accelerated greatly. To this end we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the modeling of multi-port pixelated structures. A genetic algorithm (GA) in conjunction with CNN is used to perform inverse design.

To implement such a multiple-antenna structure in handset environments, conventional design approaches rely on fine tuning the geometric parameters of antenna layouts. In this paper, a completely different framework is implemented to develop the multiple antennas. Rather than tuning the geometric parameters, we discretize the design space into several pixels. Afterward, powerful multi-objective optimization algorithms may automatically find the best antenna topologies by varying the distribution of these pixels. Our preliminary results show that the impedance requirement of each antenna can be met, and the mutual coupling between the multiple antennas can be kept at a very low level Most importantly, all the performances are automatically determined by the pixelated design technique. Therefore, the design cycle can be greatly reduced.","2162-7673","978-1-4799-6670-7","10.1109/APEMC.2015.7175232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7175232","","Sociology;Statistics;Antennas;Optimization;Couplings","","","","12","IEEE","6 Aug 2015","26-29 May 2015","26-29 May 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Full-Range Amplitude–Phase Metacells for Sidelobe Suppression of Metalens Antenna Using Prior-Knowledge-Guided Deep- Learning -Enabled Synthesis","P. Liu; Z. N.

The PK-DL synthesis method is based on a conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (cDCGAN). First, the metacells are pixelated to offer the higher degrees of design freedom and expand their transmission responses to full 2-D coverage of amplitude and phase responses so that a full-range metacell dataset is built up to simultaneously control the amplitude and phase of a single metacell. Conventionally, by optimizing the dimensions of predefined patterns of a metacell, only the phase response of a single metacell is achieved with a specific amplitude response, and vice versa. The metalens design based on the synthesized metacells has much higher degrees of freedom so that the metalens antenna has the potential to break the ceiling of performance and to realize more functions than existing metalens designs. As examples, two types of single-lens metalens antennas are designed for sidelobe suppression using the proposed metacell dataset. The first metalens is excited by a dipole antenna with an omnidirectional radiation pattern to demonstrate the simultaneous control of amplitude and phase responses using the synthesized metacells. The second metalens fed by a standard horn antenna is designed to suppress the SLLs in both the E- and H-planes. The horn-fed square metalens has an aperture of  $13.2\times 13.2\,\,\lambda _{0}$  at 12 GHz. Measurement shows that the proposed metalens antenna realizes the gain of 26.9 dBi at 12 GHz and the first SLLs in the E- and H-planes are −33.2 and −30.9 dB, respectively. The proposed synthesis method greatly expands the boundary of amplitude and phase responses of a single metacell so that the metacell dataset offers much higher degrees of freedom for not only metalenses but also other metasurfaces.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2023.3263929","Advanced Research and Technology Innovation Centre (ARTIC), the National University of Singapore(grant numbers:A-0005947-15-00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097635","Deep learning (DL);full-range amplitude–phase metacells;metalens antenna;sidelobe suppression;synthesis method","Dipole antennas;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna feeds;Antennas;Metasurfaces;Transmitting antennas;Image quality","","56","","49","IEEE","7 Apr 2023","June 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the past decade, antenna designs for MIMO systems rely more and more on tuning the geometric parameters of an initial layout. For instance, if the design goal is to generate double resonances in dual bands and reduce the mutual coupling between multiple antenna elements, a planar-inverted F antenna is typically considered as the design prototype along with a predetermined decoupling technique; afterward, the geometric parameters of the prototype are identified and fine tuned via either a trial-and-error approach or traditional shapeoptimization methods. However, such approaches may fail to produce a satisfactory design if the detailed initial guess is incorrect; moreover, fine tuning continuous variables is a repetitive and tedious task, which expands the designcycle and increases development cost.","","978-1-4799-3746-2","10.1109/USNC-URSI.2014.6955445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6955445","","Antennas;Image quality;MIMO;Tuning;Layout;Finite element analysis;Prototypes","","","","","IEEE","13 Nov 2014","6-11 July 2014","6-11 July 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rapid growth of the market for wireless communication devices demands more flexibility in coordinating different wireless standards and devices while maintaining a small device profile. This has produced a need for compact antennas with frequency tunability across multiple operating bands. Many techniques have been developed to produce miniaturized antennas, including the use of slots and high-permittivity dielectrics. At the same time, techniques for producing tunable multi-band antennas have been devised. These include the loading of a multi-resonance structure, such as a multi-branch monopole or a planar inverted F antenna, with varactor diodes. However, such tuning techniques typically result in limited size reduction or increased manufacturing complexity. In this paper, a technique of producing miniaturized, tunable, planar monopole antennas is presented. Miniaturization of the antenna is achieved by optimizing the geometry of a pixelated metallic patch surrounding a monopole antenna through a genetic algorithm. Full wave simulations using HFSS have been employed to demonstrate that tuning of the miniaturized antenna can be achieved by varying the capacitance of an appropriate varactor diode placed at a proper location. As a result, an ultra-compact monopole antenna that fits into hemisphere of 5.3 mm radius, which is equivalent of λ /22 at 2.1 GHz, is realized. A prototype antenna with integrated DC bias has been fabricated and measured to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design. It is seen that by varying the capacitance of the varactor diode, two resonance frequencies can be continuously tuned simultaneously. The tuning range of the antenna covers multiple frequency bands for WLAN and WiMAX, which makes it suitable for wireless applications. The radiation patterns and efficiency of the antenna will be measured and validated through simulations.","","978-1-4799-3746-2","10.1109/USNC-URSI.2014.6955444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6955444","","Antennas;Antenna measurements;Wireless communication;Varactors;Tuning;Educational institutions;Laboratories","","","","","IEEE","13 Nov 2014","6-11 July 2014","6-11 July 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the narrow-band response of the resonance limits the ability to fully analyze the characteristic fingerprint spectrum of samples, resulting in potential false-positive outcomes. Here, we have developed a broadband terahertz metasensor capable of individually detecting various biomolecules as well as mixed biomolecular compounds by leveraging a pixelated multi-Fano metasurface. The designed array units consist of four uneven-length gold micro-rods, breaking the symmetry to form three Fano resonance peaks within the terahertz frequency range. By adjusting the lengths of these micro-rods, we achieved an approximate spectral coverage of 1 THz width with a spectral resolution less than 50 GHz. Importantly, the design can be extended to larger spectral regions by varying the geometric parameters. Furthermore, this metasensor, composed of a multi-resonant metasurface integrating self-similar micro-antenna arrays, achieved a remarkable 70-fold enhancement in near-field intensity across various spectral bands. Through experiment based on the designed metasurface, we obtained distinct recognition results for glutamate, GABA, and their mixture using this sensor.

A practical way to achieve this stands on the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology, which uses pixelated reflective meta-surfaces with individually tuneable unit cells. Besides improving signal coverage and reducing not spots, the RIS reduces signal variability, which is underpinned by impaired electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation. Wireless communications in complex occur via multiple propagation paths that are best characterised by a statistical channel model. Therefore, antenna arrays and RIS devices are excited by a stochastic EM field, i.e., instantaneous variability at a specific point in space is hard-to-predict. Inherently, channel Hardening (CH) occurs in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems where the wireless signal is spatially averaged through a large antenna array, thus reducing EM field fluctuations. As a practical consequence, the receive array perceives a dramatic reduction of the multi-path fading. However, the randomness is still present in the EM waves impinging onto the array, but the impact of signal fluctuations on the communication link is weaker at receiver. While CH was observed in real-life propagation channel, both supporting idealised and non-idealised multi-path fading statistics, an interesting research question has configured over the last year within the wireless communication community, which asks whether CH can be achieved in RIS-assisted SISO wireless propagation channels. Some effort has been devoted to address this question from both system level and EM perspectives.","2573-3036","978-9-46396-811-9","10.23919/INC-USNC-URSI61303.2024.10632500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10632500","","Fading channels;Fluctuations;Wireless networks;Propagation;Prevention and mitigation;Stochastic processes;Receivers","","","","0","","21 Aug 2024","14-19 July 2024","14-19 July 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are obtained by a dense periodic texture of small elements printed on a grounded slab. Changing the dimension of the elements, being the sub-wavelength 2D-periodicity equal, gives the visual effect of a pixelated image and the electromagnetic effect of a modulation of the equivalent local reactance. The modulated metasurface reactance (MMR) so obtained is able to transform surface or guided waves into different wavefield configurations with required properties. The MMR allows a local modification of the dispersion equation and, at constant operating frequency, of the local wavevector. Therefore, a metasurface modulation permits addressing the propagation path of a surface wave, according with a generalized Fermat principle, as happen in ray-field propagation in inhomogeneous solid medium. This may serve for designing lenses or point-source driven beam-forming networks. When the MMR exhibits a periodic modulation along the SW wavevector, the wave propagation is accompanied by leakage; i.e., a surface wave is transformed into a leaky-wave, and the structure itself becomes an extremely flat antenna. In every case, introducing asymmetry in the pixel allows for a polarization control.","","978-1-5386-0465-6","10.1109/ISANP.2017.8229086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8229086","","Optical surface waves;Europe;Electromagnetics;Surface waves;Frequency modulation;Antennas","","","","","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2017","30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

S-LDM uses polarization-independent TE and TM spectrums to guide the denoising of random Gaussian noise, and a semi-supervised learning strategy is adopted for training the latent diffusion model (LDM). First, the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset and its extended version are selected for constructing the polarization-independence frequency-selective metasurface with asymmetry  $28\times 28$  pixelates. Then, an autoencoder (AE) network is adopted to compress the  $28\times 28$  metasurface pattern (MSP) into an  $8\times 8$  latent space, and such compression method has effectively shortened the training time. Next, pseudolabels for unlabeled data are constructed, and their loss values are added as dynamic regularization weights in the total loss function. In doing so, S-LDM generates more precise metasurfaces than supervised training. Full-wave simulation results demonstrate that the dual-polarization frequency-selective metasurfaces can be accurately reverse-generated based on the desired TE–TM spectrum in the test dataset. Reverse design metasurfaces have also been successfully achieved by randomly generating Gaussian spectrums with various frequency-selective and polarization capabilities. Finally, a real-world metasurface is fabricated by S-LDM.

In this paper we propose a novel method for calibration of such arrays on aerial vehicles using the backscatter from the terrain below. To limit the extent of the terrestrial targets, the relative motion of the vehicle with respect to the ground can be used to form a pixelated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image of the scene. The individual pixels of this image are used as calibration targets for a pair of transmitter and receiver modules. This way for an array with N transceiver modules, $\boldsymbol{NXN}$ SAR images can be formed, co-registered, and used to determine the phase variations across the array elements. It is interesting to note that the measured phase difference between the backscatter from two co-registered SAR images can be averaged over all pixels to provide a much better estimate of the array phase error. Array channels can be aligned within the measurement phase errors, allowing for calibration without the needs for signals-of-opportunity or strategically placed calibration targets. Monte Carlo simulation of array beamforming with random phase difference errors on each element can then be used to determine degradation of array performance metrics.","1947-1491","978-1-6654-4228-2","10.1109/USNC-URSI52151.2023.10238071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10238071","","Phased arrays;Phase measurement;Array signal processing;Measurement uncertainty;Receivers;Radar polarimetry;Transceivers","","2","","7","IEEE","7 Sep 2023","23-28 July 2023","23-28 July 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its goal is to reconstruct the shape of conductors from their scattered fields at some distances. When viewed from the pixelated imaging viewpoint, any pixel in the imaging domain is either a conductor or background (air); thus such an inverse scattering problem has binary solutions for all pixels. Under the high-frequency physical optics (PO) approximation, the scattered field is formulated as a linear problem in terms of a local binary shape function. A binary inversion method is proposed for the detection and shape reconstruction of a flat PEC reflector from high-frequency scattered field measurements. To exploit the underlying binary structure, a Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) prior model is employed to perform a binary enforcement mechanism. This binary enforcement mechanism can push each pixel of the inversion domain to have a value equal to either zero or one. Then, the damped generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) is integrated with the proposed prior model to address the binary linear inverse problem from the Bayesian inference perspective. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed BG Binary Inversion method. The performance improvement of the proposed method is attributed to the exploitation of the binary prior information of the solution and GAMP technique.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2019.2952005","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601245,61601242); State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves(grant numbers:K201724); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2016M601693); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:NY214047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897144","Bayesian inference;Bernoulli–Gaussian (BG) prior model;local shape function (LSF);physics optics (PO)","Inverse problems;Shape;Bayes methods;Imaging;Electromagnetics;Image reconstruction;Electromagnetic scattering","","11","","29","IEEE","12 Nov 2019","April 2020","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional methods to design antennas, and rf circuits include using static and fixed materials: conductors such as copper and substrates like FR4. However, with the growing demand in wireless communication in areas like 5/6 G, and IoT more versatile, portable, and adaptable devices are needed to accommodate a variety of applications. LMs offer an ability to create a multitude of different RF circuits/antennas such as reconfigurable filters, polarization converters, reflect arrays, meta-surfaces, etc. Fluids are a more malleable substance and allow for easier manipulation into any arbitrary shape or structure. Combing LMs with pixelated topology metasurfaces organized with Genetic Algorithms (GA) opens the door for many different electromagnetic (EM) applications.","2642-4339","978-9-4639-6809-6","10.23919/URSIGASS57860.2023.10265648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10265648","","Wireless communication;Radio frequency;Smart pixels;Liquids;Shape;Design methodology;Metasurfaces","","2","","6","","3 Oct 2023","19-26 Aug. 2023","19-26 Aug. 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A genetic algorithm is employed to design the pixelated metasurface for broadband absorption. The pixelated metasurface is screen-printed on a flexible polyimide film and integrated into foam core sandwich layers and composite layers for obtaining a flat, robust, and lightweight absorber sample. The measured microwave absorption of the sample is 90%, with a fractional bandwidth of 102% in the C- and X-bands. The designed metasurface embedded microwave absorbing composite is applied to investigate the effect of the curvature radius on the RCS considering the performance and manufacturing cost. The proposed design on a curved surface with a 200-mm curvature radius achieves an average RCS reduction of up to 96% relative to that of the copper counterpart from full-wave simulation, which is validated via RCS measurements. The metasurface embedded microwave absorbing composite on curved surfaces can be used to increase stealth performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3620844","Korea Research Institute for Defense Technology Planning and Advancement (KRIT) Grant; Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA)(grant numbers:KRIT-CT-21-010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11202464","Curved surfaces;electromagnetic wave absorption;genetic algorithm;metasurfaces;radar cross section","Metasurfaces;Absorption;Image quality;Microwave measurement;Electromagnetic heating;Resistance;Radar cross-sections;Microwave oscillators;Broadband communication;Autonomous aerial vehicles","","1","","56","CCBY","13 Oct 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
