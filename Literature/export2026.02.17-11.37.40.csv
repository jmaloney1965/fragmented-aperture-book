We show that, for the same overall incoming light, a fragmented aperture leads to better motion and defocus deblurring than a (compact) conventional circular aperture. We demonstrate that not only fragmented apertures preserve more spectrum of an image of the scene than traditional circular apertures, but they also allow a better identification of blur scale. Our algorithm estimates both motion blur magnitude and direction as well as defocus blur scale at each pixel. The estimation of the blur parameters is addressed by using local projections on subspaces and L1 regularization, while deblurring is posed as a variational minimization problem and solved via linearization of the Euler-Lagrange equations. The technique produces convincing results on real scenario.","2381-8549","978-1-4577-1303-3","10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6116444","motion-blur;defocus;single image;space-varying deblurring;coded aperture photography","Apertures;Kernel;Noise level;Cameras;Degradation;Lenses;Estimation","","3","","18","IEEE","29 Dec 2011","11-14 Sept. 2011","11-14 Sept. 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A fragmented aperture antenna is a patchwork of discrete conducting and dielectric units distributed over the specified aperture. The arrangement of the units is determined using an efficient, multistage procedure that incorporates the genetic algorithm for optimization and the finite-difference time-domain method for the electromagnetic computation. Typically, the criterion for optimum performance has been broadband gain at a particular angle.

Unlike other concepts that use scale invariance to utilize a specific region of the aperture that changes with frequency (known as the active region), the FA is designed to utilize the entire aperture over the entire frequency band. The result is that FA antennas routinely approach the theoretical limit of antenna performance based on a uniformly illuminated aperture. However, because FAs consist of complex printed metallic patterns on single or multi layer substrates, the design necessarily is heavily simulation driven. Our proprietary design processes have been very successful in designing apertures for a wide variety of applications. The metallic pattern is described using a binary code (typically hundreds of bits), and the pattern is designed using a genetic algorithm on a large computer cluster. Because the design space for these antennas is enormous, it is unclear if a well-designed “good” antenna is near the best possible antenna. An additional question is whether or not our genetic search algorithms are efficiently searching the design space. To address these questions, over a decade ago GTRI researchers created a very limited antenna design that could be described using only 18 bits. Every possible antenna in this space was evaluated and algorithm convergence was proven. In the last decade, computers have been much more powerful, and our design process has evolved to allow much more complicated patterns. To update the previous results, ACL researchers recently used a large computer cluster to evaluate every possible antenna in a 24-bit design (2^24 possible antennas, which is 64 times larger than the previous dataset). The evaluation took nearly a month of cluster time and produced gigabytes of simulation results. Using this library of known solutions, we can quickly test design algorithms for convergence time. The encoding strategy is shown below. Bits 1–23 specify on/off regions of metal. The 24th bit specifies a choice of two feed regions (compare the cells marked 24 below). Detailed results based on this dataset will be presented at the conference.","","978-1-4799-1129-5","10.1109/USNC-URSI.2013.6715421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6715421","","Aperture antennas;Genetic algorithms;Computers;Clustering algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis","","2","","","IEEE","20 Jan 2014","7-13 July 2013","7-13 July 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the coherent summation of the return echoes and the random electromagnetic interference, a SAR image will be significantly affected by the noise, reducing the readability of the image. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose an iterative non-local denoising method based on multi-resolution. First, the cascade downsampling is performed to get the multi-resolution sub-images. Then, the 2-D discrete cosine transform is applied to each fragment segmented from the sub-images. After that, grouping the similar fragments by using the pHash algorithm. And the basic denoising image can be obtained by performing collaborative filtering and aggregating. Finally, a denoising image can be acquired after iterating processing.

We show experimentally that this indeed results in aperture efficiencies closely approaching the upper bounds achievable for some selected feed system, and offers a significant improvement over that obtained with conventional reflectarrays (that is, those not using similarity-synthesized fragmented elements).

This often results in residual range cell migration (RCM) exceeding several or even dozens of range resolution cells, which notably degrades the performance of traditional autofocus algorithms and seriously affects the quality of real-time imaging. Considering this, we propose a real-time residual RCM correction scheme based on the autocorrelated normalized cross-power spectrum (ANCPS). First, the range-compressed image is segmented into blocks based on the azimuth and range. The ANCPS is then used to estimate the optimal residual RCM for each subblock. Second, the optimal segment is selected from the residual RCM curve fragments estimated by various subblocks. Finally, the residual RCM fragments are spliced and filtered to correct the complete data. When the algorithm is deployed on a GPU platform, it only takes 1.39 s to process an  $8\times 40$  K high-resolution original SAR image, and the calculation time is reduced by 94.6% compared with only using a CPU for calculation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed residual RCM correction scheme has good convergence, can achieve subpixel residual RCM compensation without iteration and interpolation, has a simple calculation process, is efficient, and has strong parallelism. It is thus suitable for deployment in GPUs and is conducive to realizing real-time SAR autofocus at a low cost and with a high resolution.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2025.3537865","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3901601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10885372","Autocorrelated normalized cross-power spectrum (ANCPS);correction of range cell migration (RCM);parallel computing;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) real-time autofocus","Image segmentation;Imaging;Graphics processing units;Radar imaging;Apertures;Real-time systems;Robustness;Trajectory;Synthetic aperture radar;Field programmable gate arrays","","","","35","IEEE","13 Feb 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To outflank this issue, many present-date missions design and commission lightweight segmented mirrors, mostly with equal sized sub-apertures. To go one step ahead, these sub-apertures could be of non-uniform sizes, in a given proportion, thereby ensuring an even smaller and lighter primary, with a marginal compromise in imaging quality. However, a fragmented mirror is very sensitive to failure of one or more of the sub-apertures, in some random fashion (most likely being hit by space debris or surge of high energy particles) or in a cluster (possibly due to failure of the actuators or control system). In such scenarios, the system suffers loss of the high-frequency components to various extents, so that the edge detection in the reconstruction process (deconvolution) becomes questionable. This is particularly true for the central sub-aperture, rendering it as the most critical component in the partially-filled primary aperture design. In such cases, the imaging system malfunctions as a whole, thereby defeating the purpose of designing of such ultra-lightweight optically-sparse primary aperture mirror with non-uniform sized sub-apertures for satellite-based sensing systems.","2153-7003","979-8-3503-6032-5","10.1109/IGARSS53475.2024.10642819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10642819","Electro-optical sensors;remote sensing;partially-filled primary aperture mirror;Point Spread Function;Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio;Structural Similarity Index Measure","Optical design;Space debris;Apertures;Optical variables measurement;Optical imaging;Mirrors;Optical sensors","","1","","24","IEEE","5 Sep 2024","7-12 July 2024","7-12 July 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experimental data were obtained with a setup consisting of a two-coordinate electromechanical scanner and a radar emitting continuous stepped-frequency signal in the range of 22.2 - 26.2 GHz. As an object of study, fragments of narrow-gauge rails were used, in which surface defects of various sizes and depths were created. A phase method for radar signal processing based on the backward propagation of its wavefront was developed, with which radar images of rails with defects were obtained. Experimental studies have shown that the developed rail surface imaging method allows detecting the presence and measuring characteristics of cracks on the tread, cleavages of the railhead, the width of the joint gap and the magnitude of the vertical step at the rails joint. High accuracy and sensitivity of the radar method, confirmed with the contact measurements matching, allow using it for fast noncontact diagnostics of the rails condition.","2155-5753","978-83-949421-5-1","10.23919/IRS48640.2020.9253797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9253797","microwave imaging;nondestructive testing;radar imaging;radar measurements;rail inspection;railway safety;synthetic aperture radar","Rails;Radar measurements;Surface waves;Radar imaging;Surface cracks;Synthetic aperture radar;Testing","","5","","10","","13 Nov 2020","5-8 Oct. 2020","5-8 Oct. 2020","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compatibility is achieved when these quantities satisfy constraints arising from physics, geometry etc. In the aggregate these quantities and constraints form a logical model of the radar. In practice the logical model is distributed over multiple people, documents and software modules thereby becoming fragmented. Fragmentation gives rise to inconsistencies and errors. The SAR Inference Engine addresses the fragmentation problem by implementing the logical model of a Sandia synthetic aperture radar in a form that is intended to be usable from system design to mission planning to actual operation of the radar.

Our experience shows that constructing a complete processing chain requires either a variety of expensive commercial software packages, or recourse to considerable bespoke software development, and in either case yields a fragmented solution not readily accessible to non-experts. It is argued that this poses a barrier to the uptake of satellite SAR by tropical forest countries, preventing them from exploiting a reliable and predictable source of remote sensing data suited to forest monitoring.

Segmentation and motion estimation are simultaneously performed by a clustering process based on color, motion, and pixel position. As a result of the clustering, an image is decomposed into region fragments. Each fragment is characterized by distribution parameters of color, pixel positions, and spatiotemporal intensity gradients. The image is described by the parameters of the region fragments; 2-D motion vectors for each fragment are obtained from the distribution parameters of the intensity gradients. By combining those features in the clustering process, regions are segmented more precisely, motion boundaries are not blurred, and the 2-D motions are obtained even in noisy areas.

The highest velocities achievable to date with other than micron-sized projectiles are obtained from explosive accelerators (shaped charge) or modified light gas guns incorporating a third stage. Such devices produce one or more randomly shaped particles of undetermined mass; and meaningful impact studies at very high velocities require a method of accurate measurement of the mass of a small fragment after acceleration but before impact. An experimental technique for mass measurement, which is simple in concept and operation, has been developed and demonstrated. A high-speed flash X-ray system is used to photograph the projectile or projectiles in flight. A theoretical treatment utilizing the X-ray mass absorption coefficient of the projectile material, and the linearity of the film density as a function of the logarithm of the exposure, is used to demonstrate that the density change over a finite area of the film is directly proportional to the mass in the path of the X-ray beam. The measurement is independent of ``blurring'' due to the finite exposure time and tumbling of the projectile. Analysis of the exposed film can be conducted in a few minutes and requires only the measurement of average density at five or six positions on the film. Independent measurements of the masses of all projectiles in the field of view are possible. The demonstrated accuracy of the technique is better than ±5 percent.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.1967.5408755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5408755","Densitometer;hypervelocity;in-flight mass;instrumentation;light gas gun;projectile;X ray","Projectiles;Guns;Explosives;Acceleration;Conductive films;Particle accelerators;Velocity measurement;Particle measurements;Shape measurement;Accelerometers","","","","7","IEEE","8 Feb 2010","March 1967","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this spectrum is also shared by many other communication systems, leading to tremendous interference in a large number of frequency bands. Although avoiding these frequency bands is a natural solution, the resulting frequency gaps not only lower the signal-to-noise ratio in the received radar signals but the fragmented radar spectrum also creates severe sidelobes, which can destroy the original features of the targets of interest. In this paper, we propose to recover this missing spectral information via a generative adversarial network, called SARGAN, which learns the relationship between original and missing-frequency-band signals by observing numerous possible training pairs in a clever way. Initial results shows that this approach is promising in tackling this challenging problem: our recovered signals achieve on average more than 18 dB gain in the signal-to-noise ratio when up to 90% of the operating spectrum is missing. Moreover, the proposed SARGAN accomplishes this performance level without any prior knowledge of the locations of the missing frequency bands.","2375-5318","978-1-5386-4167-5","10.1109/RADAR.2018.8378737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8378737","Spectral recovery;missing frequency bands;generative adversarial network;synthetic aperture radar;ultra-wideband","Generators;Synthetic aperture radar;Gallium nitride;Frequency-domain analysis;Ultra wideband radar;Radar imaging","","9","","19","IEEE","11 Jun 2018","23-27 April 2018","23-27 April 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the fragmentation of nucleus B was reported in April of 2006, fresh fragments were expected to be detected. A total of 54 fragments were discovered within a 1$'$.60 $\times$ 1$'$.13 region, southwest of nucleus B. Carrying out aperture photometry for the fragments, we obtained the power-law index of the cumulative luminosity function, $\alpha=0.222$. If we assume that the CCD flux of a fragment is proportional to the cross section, the equation $q = 5\alpha + 1$ can be derived, where $q$ is the power-law index of the cumulative size distribution, and therefore $q$ = 2.1. Due to the large FOV of the camera ($34' \times 27'$), we might also be able to find fragments split from nucleus B before the perihelion passage in 2006. Upon searching for such fragments in the image, no object was found; since the approximate limiting magnitude is 24.2 mag, a bare nucleus (i.e., non-active comet) with 13.3 m in radius could be detected in the image; however, the real detection limit should be less than a radius of 13.3 m, because a comet at the same heliocentric distance as nucleus B of 1.1 AU would be active, and an active comet whose magnitude is 24.2 mag has a smaller nucleus than 13.3 m in radius due to the brightness of the dust coma.","2053-051X","","10.1093/pasj/59.2.381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8208731","comets;comets: individual (73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3);solar system","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","April 2007","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, the complex surface characteristics of sea ice in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, including open water, new ice, young ice, and first year ice, present significant challenges for accurate classification. To address these challenges, we propose SI-MCLA-Net, a novel deep learning model based on MobileNetV3, specifically tailored for sea ice classification. The proposed approach integrates the Lightweight Adaptive Extraction (LAE) and Multi-scale Feature Extraction (MFE) modules. Through its adaptive mechanism, the LAE module dynamically adjusts feature weights to highlight the unique scattering characteristics of different ice types, including open water, new ice, young ice, and first year ice, while minimizing the impact of background noise. To improve multi-scale feature extraction, the MFE module accommodates both large ice sheets and smaller fragmented features, common in SAR imagery. Meanwhile, the CGAFusion module leverages multiple attention mechanisms to pinpoint critical regions, such as ice cracks and irregular ice blocks, and enhances segmentation precision by fusing information across different scales. Experimental results on the Gaofen-3 satellite dataset demonstrate that SI-MCLA-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 0.523% improvement in the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric, and excels in handling the diverse and complex nature of sea ice conditions.","2153-7003","979-8-3315-0810-4","10.1109/IGARSS55030.2025.11313873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11313873","Synthetic Aperture Radar;Sea Ice Classification;Gaofen-3;Deep Learning","Water;Measurement;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Navigation;Spaceborne radar;Feature extraction;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar;Sea ice","","","","","IEEE","30 Dec 2025","3-8 Aug. 2025","3-8 Aug. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even at the comparably short wavelength of the SAR instrument mounted onboard the Sentinel-1 satellites (C-band, 5.6 cm), dielectric discontinuities in the soil profile can give rise to strong subsurface scattering signals that dominate the returns from the soil surface. In such situations, backscatter decreases when the soils get wet because the damping of subsurface scattering signals is more important than the increased backscatter from the soil surface. By comparing backscatter time series with modelled soil moisture data, this characteristic behaviour can be detected, opening up the possibility of using SAR data for mapping subsurface scatterers at high spatial resolution. This contribution introduces an index for mapping surface scatterers using a global Sentinel-1 backscatter datacube. We computed the index over a study region covering the Iberian Peninsula and north-western Africa, which was the focus of a previous study using the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). The results show that the Sentinel-1-based index reflects large-scale patterns of subsurface scattering as detected by ASCAT very well. At local scales, the Sentinel-1 maps reveal patterns related to soil and landscape features in much more detail than depicted by currently available soil maps.","","978-3-8007-6286-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10659613","","","","","","","","30 Aug 2024","23-26 April 2024","23-26 April 2024","VDE","VDE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel 2D autofocus algorithm, thoroughly utilizing all the available data and therefore achieving superior estimation performance. Via analytical study, we show that the partial derivative of the 2D error with respect to the azimuth frequency is approximable as a function of single argument, after appropriate change of variable. The established property enables a scheme for the azimuth phase error (APE) measurement, where the polar formatted data are fragmented along the range frequency and then aligned along the azimuth frequency, in order to equalize phase gradients in different fragments. On the one hand, such a scheme avoids the necessity to divide the full-aperture signal into subapertures, while on the other hand, it involves the whole signal support. Improved accuracy of the resulting estimate is achieved through the joint inter-fragment estimation of the APE gradient. The proposed algorithm, based on the mentioned scheme, was validated via computer simulations. The conducted experiments confirmed its preference against the existing techniques. The preference is particularly distinct for low SNR imagery.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2020.2988143","Research Project Coordination Unit of Near East University(grant numbers:FEN-2017-01-006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9075422","Synthetic aperture radar (SAR);azimuth phase error (APE);residual range cell migration (RCM);two-dimensional autofocus;phase gradient autofocus (PGA);polar format algorithm (PFA);low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","Azimuth;Estimation;Synthetic aperture radar;Apertures;Signal to noise ratio;Electronics packaging","","11","","35","IEEE","21 Apr 2020","2020","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two image processing algorithms based on either maximum or minimum entropy, namely, the Burg algorithm and the alternative iteration deconvolution based on minimum entropy (AIDME) are compared.

In addition to the main dipole magnets, the Super-FRS requires two types of quadrupole magnet and different corrector magnets (steering dipole, sextupole, and octupole). The quadrupole magnets and the corrector magnets are assembled as a cold mass column in a common cryogenic module called a multiplet.

The steerer and the octupole magnet, which is embedded in the quadrupole magnet, are cos-theta magnets. As a part of FAIR early science program (ES), installation of the Super-FRS is planned in 2025 and its commissioning in 2026.

The Huanjing-2 (HJ-2E), jointly developed by China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment and Ministry of Emergency Management, provides abundant S-band SAR data, offering strong support for environmental disaster and emergency response. While deep learning methods are now extensively employed for SAR flood segmentation tasks, existing models still face challenges when segmenting discontinuously distributed small flooded areas under agricultural environments, including insufficient classification accuracy, poor structural integrity, and blurred boundaries. To address these issues, this study focuses on high-precision flood mapping in agricultural areas by integrating deep learning methods with HJ-2E S-band SAR data. The first S-band SAR flood segmentation dataset is constructed, derived from HJ-2E data, and includes horizontal transmit-horizontal receive (HH) and horizontal transmit-horizontal receive (HV) dual-polarization backscattering features. Subsequently, a novel deep learning model, S-band flood segmentation U-shaped network (SFSUNet), was designed for flood segmentation using S-band SAR data. SFSUNet adopts the Hiera network from the visual foundation model SAM2 as its backbone and integrates the adapter module to enable efficient cross-domain knowledge transfer from natural images to S-band SAR data. In addition, a full-level channel–spatial interaction block is designed to enhance the modeling and extraction of features for small, fragmented flood areas in agricultural regions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through experiments in two agricultural flood-prone areas. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed SFSUNet model significantly outperformed ten existing models. It achieved an intersection over union of 91.87%, outperforming the best comparative method by 3.15%, with precision and recall reaching 96.41% and 95.13%, respectively. Furthermore, experimental analysis of different polarization inputs revealed that the combination of HH and HV dual-polarization data effectively enhanced flood segmentation accuracy. In single-polarization scenarios, HV polarization exhibited superior performance to HH polarization in identifying flooded agricultural parcels. This study provides critical technical support for the application of HJ-2E data in agricultural flood monitoring and lays a foundation for future research and applications of S-band SAR.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3587896","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2024YFD1500603-03); International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals(grant numbers:E23Z0501); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971395); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11079287","Agricultural flood mapping;fragmented flood regions;Huanjing-2 (HJ-2E);S-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR);semantic segmentation","Floods;Accuracy;Deep learning;Radar polarimetry;Data models;Feature extraction;Biological system modeling;Monitoring;Disasters;Backscatter","","","","76","CCBY","14 Jul 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

And then under the Markov context, both the determinate PDF and the kernel estimate method are adopted respectively, to form a primary classification. Next, the primary classification results are fused using the evidence theory in an unsupervised way to get the scene classification. Finally, a regularization step is used, in which an iterated maximum selecting approach is introduced to control the fragments and modify the errors of the classification. Use of the kernel estimate and evidence theory can describe the complicated scenes with little prior knowledge and eliminate the ambiguities of the primary classification results.

The unit cell design consists of a printed circuit board (PCB) stack-up with a driven aperture layer that is DC connected with a single metal pin to a fragmented combiner layer. This single connection indicates that the antenna is unbalanced and therefore no balun or differential amplifier is required. Additionally, there are no vias required for this unbalanced array, allowing for this concept to be easily scaled to lower or higher frequencies. Further, the fragmented combiner is a PCB-based component, which eliminates the need for traditional commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components e.g. Wilkinson chips for this specific application.

Existing multiscale ship detection algorithms for SAR data employ multiscale feature pyramids or anchor-free extractors to capture features from large ship targets. However, the significant feature variation due to the internal structure and reflection of ships makes it difficult for current extractors to provide a consistent feature description, often resulting in fragmented detection outcomes for ship targets. This article decomposes the large ship detection problem into the detection of individual ship components (including tail, hull, and head), proposing a novel component-based detection method for large ship targets in SAR images. The proposed method enhances the network's efficiency in feature propagation and aggregation across different layers using the generalized efficient layer aggregation network (GELAN) structure. Following the feature extraction of GELAN, a multilevel multipooling channel attention is integrated to optimize the feature extraction structure in a hierarchical manner. The method also incorporates environmental features around the target to strengthen the association between different ship components. The detected ship components are connected using a topological relationship algorithm based on the component structure, culminating in the generation of ship target detection results. Experiments on the large ship component model dataset constructed for this article demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed algorithm over the preoptimized YOLOv8. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves promising detection performance when compared with the current state-of-the-art you only look once series algorithms and multiscale SAR ship detection algorithms. The algorithm also effectively avoided noticeable loss or false detection of small ship targets present in the dataset.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3514898","Foundation Strengthening Fund Project, China(grant numbers:2023-JCJQ-JJ-0343); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(grant numbers:2042022dx0001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10787532","Component model;large ship targets;ship target detection;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);you only look once (YOLO)","Marine vehicles;Feature extraction;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar polarimetry;Optical imaging;Accuracy;Convolution;YOLO;Tail;Radar imaging","","12","","59","CCBY","11 Dec 2024","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In Northern Vietnam (Red River Delta), rice mapping using SAR is a challenge and is rarely performed because of the complex land-use/land-cover. Nevertheless, information about rice fields is needed for hydrological simulations in river basins such as the Cau River basin. The objective of this research is to investigate the potential of RADARSAT-2 band- C in identifying rice fields over a large and fragmented land-use area. Two methods are proposed, one for each data type, adapted to the land-use/land-cover of the study area. The thresholding technique, with a statistical analysis of the temporal variation of rice backscattering, was applied to the HH like-polarized ratio of dual-pol data. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was applied to the full quad-pol and a single HH-polarization calculated from polarimetric data. This study demonstrates that RADARSAT-2 dual- and quad-pol data can be successfully used to identify cultivated rice fields. However, the dual-pol data seems less efficient than the quad-pol data and the SVM classification is more flexible than the thresholding technique. Between the full quad-pol and a single polarization, the overall classification accuracy shows that the results derived from the single HH polarization are 3 to 10% less accurate than those derived from the classification of full quad-pol data. The results show the usefulness of polarimetric C-band data for the identification of rice fields in Northern Vietnam.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2586102","Canadian International Development Agency under the Cau River Basin Project; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7522620","Cau river basin;RADARSAT-2;rice identification;support vector machine (SVM);thresholding","Rivers;Remote sensing;Satellites;Agriculture;Optical sensors;Earth;Synthetic aperture radar","","42","","60","OAPA","26 Jul 2016","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the imaging characteristics of ISAR often produce sparse or incomplete point clouds. In order to surmount this constraint, we propose an innovative approach for point cloud completion leveraging the inverse transformation abilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our approach involves pre-training the GAN on a diverse dataset of 3D point cloud models, allowing it to learn rich geometric and semantic distributions. The proposed PointGAN module enhances feature representation by leveraging ancestral node information, thereby improving the model's adaptability and completion accuracy. Furthermore, the method operates in an unsupervised manner, generating 3D point clouds through random latent encoding and eliminating dependence on manually labeled data. Experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed method outstrips current networks with respect to chamfer distance and intersection over union (IoU) metrics. Producing 3D point clouds from sequences of inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images plays a vital role in evaluating the operational conditions of space targets. Nevertheless, the nature of ISAR imaging frequently results in point clouds that are either sparse or fragmented. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an innovative approach for completing point clouds, leveraging the inverse mapping potential inherent in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).","","979-8-3315-4146-0","10.1109/ICVISP64524.2024.10959392","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201623,62101494); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10959392","inverse synthetic aperture radar(ISAR);point cloud completion;generative adversarial network(GAN);space target","Point cloud compression;Solid modeling;Adaptation models;Three-dimensional displays;Semantics;Imaging;Radar imaging;Signal processing;Generative adversarial networks;Inverse synthetic aperture radar","","","","15","IEEE","17 Apr 2025","27-29 Dec. 2024","27-29 Dec. 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Four sites were imaged, a calibration zone and a front glacier close to Kangerlussuaq, a dry accumulation zone North of the polar circle, a percolated accumulation zone East of Narsassuaq, and an intermediate zone between accumulation and ablation zone. The engine fragment plume of an uncontained engine failure on a commercial jet-liner (about 190 days earlier) was in the middle of the percolated accumulation zone, providing several known buried fragments, as well as opportunities to unravel unknown buried fragments that may have an interest for the engine failure investigation.

Accurately monitoring rice cultivation areas plays a vital role in supporting the governmental formulation of food policies and agricultural sustainability. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are not affected by weather and can acquire backscatter information below the rice canopy, which is beneficial for long-term continuous monitoring of rice. However, most existing studies made less consideration to integrated research on rice cultivation with diverse planting modes under complex terrain, which makes it difficult to reflect the real situation of rice cultivation. Therefore, in Ningbo, China, where the rice planting modes have single-crop early, middle, late rice, and double-crop rice, the rice fields are fragmented, and the terrain is complex, which is selected as the experimental area. Four types of rice features (SAR backscatter, topographic, statistical, and phenological features) in different cropping modes were thoroughly explored, and the feature datasets were correspondingly constructed using all available Sentinel-1 SAR images in 2022. The combination of statistical and phenological characteristics resulted in the highest recognition accuracies for single-crop early, middle, late rice, and double-crop rice, with F1-scores of 0.85, 0.84, 0.89, and 0.89, respectively. In addition, the reliability of the multiple cropping mode rice identification framework in this study is discussed quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the temporal resolution of the time-series images, the smoothing method of the time-series SAR data, and the interference of other land cover types. This study can provide a reference for other rice planting areas with complex rice cropping modes.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3430528","Public Projects of Ningbo City(grant numbers:2023S102); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LY22D010002); Key Projects of Major Scientific and Technological Tasks in Ningbo(grant numbers:2021Z107); Key Technology Breakthrough Plan Project of Science and Innovation Yongjiang 2035(grant numbers:2024Z262); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing Municipality(grant numbers:CSTB2022NSCQMSX0588); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42122009); Zhejiang Province “Pioneering Soldier” and “Leading Goose” R&D Project(grant numbers:2023C01027); Ningbo Science and Technology Innovation 2025 Major Special Project(grant numbers:2021Z107,2022Z032); Youth Scientist Project National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFF1305600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10601712","Multiple cropping modes;paddy rice;phenological characteristics;statistical characteristics;time-series Sentinel-1","Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;Remote sensing;Crops;Optical sensors;Optical reflection;Optical imaging","","5","","42","IEEE","18 Jul 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, for low grazing angles and high sea states, wave shading and sea spikes make the small target detection even more difficult. This letter proposed a novel phase-feature detector of small targets in sea clutter. Three phase features, which correspond to different radar scattering mechanisms between the target and sea surface, are extracted in the phase domain of radar echoes, namely, the number of phase crossing zero points, the maximum value of the phase difference probability density function, and the decorrelation time of the phase difference. A detector with a controllable false alarm rate (FAR) based on phase features is constructed using the fast convex hull learning algorithm. Experimental results on measured databases demonstrate that the proposed phase-feature detector attains better performance than the existing tri-feature detectors.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2021.3093620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481159","Fast convex hull learning algorithm;feature-based detection;phase features;sea clutter;small target detection","Clutter;Feature extraction;Radar;Detectors;Radar clutter;Radar cross-sections;Object detection","","36","","16","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The likelihood ratio edge detector and local non-maximal suppression are performed on the result images for edge enhancements and detection. In the second stage, mathematical morphology techniques are used to reconnect the fragmented lines and remove the uninterested patterns in the binary image which is produced by thresholding the enhanced image after edge detection. Spatial statistics including spatial mean and spreading coefficient of each cluster (object) in the binary image are calculated in order to simply classify their shapes. The clusters with large spreading coefficient will be remained and others will be removed.

In these regions, optical images can only obtained fragmented data through the cloud gap or even impossible to get, which cannot meet the requirements of rapid and accurate agricultural monitoring. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be rarely affected by atmospheric disturbances and sensitive to surface structure characteristics, so the SAR data has good application potential in agriculture.

To improve the accuracy and completeness of road extraction, we propose a neural network-based algorithm, which takes the connectivity and direction features of roads into consideration, named RoadSeg-CD. It consists of two branches: one is the main branch for road segmentation; the other is the auxiliary branch for learning road directions. In the main branch, a connectivity array is designed to utilize local contextual information and construct a connectivity loss based on the predicted probabilities of neighboring pixels. In the auxiliary branch, we proposed a novel road direction map, which is used for learning the directions of roads. The two branches are connected by specific feature fusion process, and the output from the main branch is taken as the road extraction result.

While methods for extracting building height from single-view shadow images have been widely studied, it remains a challenging task. The main reasons are as follows: 1) the traditional method for extracting shadow information exhibits low accuracy; and 2) the use of only shadow information to extract building height results in limited application scenarios. To solve the above problems, this article introduces building side and shadow information to complement each other, and proposes a building height extraction method from high-resolution single-view remote sensing images using shadow and side information. First, we propose the RMU-Net method, which utilizes multiscale features for the extraction of shadow and side information. This method aims to address issues related to pixel detail loss and imprecise edge segmentation, which result from significant scale differences within segmentation targets. Additionally, we employ the area threshold method to optimize the segmentation results, specifically to tackle small stray patches and holes, enhancing the overall integrity and accuracy of shadow and side information extraction. Second, we propose a method for building height extraction that integrates shadow and side information based on an enhanced proportional coefficient model. The accuracy of measuring building side and shadow lengths is improved by incorporating the fishing net method, informed by our analysis of the geometric relationships among buildings. Finally, we establish a dataset containing building shadow and side information from remote sensing images, and select multiple areas for experimental analysis. The results demonstrate a shadow extraction accuracy of 91.03% and a side extraction accuracy of 90.29%. Additionally, the average absolute error (MAE) for building height extraction is 1.22, while the average root mean square error is 1.21. Furthermore, the proposed method's validity and scalability are affirmed through experimental analyses of applicability and anti-interference performance in extensive areas.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3372113","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42301473,42171355,U22A20565); Postdoctoral Innovation Talents Support Program(grant numbers:BX20230299); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M742884); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province of China(grant numbers:24NSFSC2264); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10457057","Building height extraction;deep learning;high-resolution remote sensing images;shadow;side","Buildings;Feature extraction;Data mining;Remote sensing;Synthetic aperture radar;Estimation;Deep learning","","27","","56","CCBYNCND","1 Mar 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the gaining interest in multielement therapy transducers enabling 3D beamsteering, the need for 3D cavitation monitoring is evident. Here, we propose two in-house built 32-element cavitation monitoring transducers for 3D passive acoustic mapping (PAM) with fixed co-registration. Based on previously in-house developed therapy matrix arrays, two different design approaches are used, one being an add-on transducer for a preclinical array and the other one being the integration of elements into the transmit aperture of a clinical array. For the experimental validation in the preclinical setup, the therapy transducer excited a microbubble solution flowing through a tube and the emissions were simultaneously recorded by the add-on transducer (1 mm elements, 4 MHz). For the clinical setup with the integrated elements (2 mm, 1 MHz), the cavitation was generated by a separate single-element focused transducer.

In particular, interrupted dwells on the target can cause gaps in the azimuth frequency domain and notching to avoid radio frequency interference can cause gaps in the range frequency domain. Similar problems can arise in the use of multistatic synthetic aperture radar where coverage of K-space may not be complete but is more likely to consist of a number of noncontiguous patches. One approach to dealing with such fragmented K-space is to use Compressive Sensing (CS) reconstruction techniques. This paper will assess the utility of CS reconstructions and make comparisons with the naïve Fourier reconstruction. This assessment will be made in terms of the robustness of classification performance obtained using both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and feature-based approaches.","","978-1-5090-2920-4","10.1109/CoSeRa.2016.7745732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745732","Compressive sensing;target recognition;ATR;K-space","Image reconstruction;Training;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar imaging;Compressed sensing;Clutter","","3","","7","Crown","17 Nov 2016","19-22 Sept. 2016","19-22 Sept. 2016","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the information of rice fields is important for hydrological simulation in the studied watershed. The purpose of the research is to adapt the classification methods and algorithms to monitor rice fields over a large and fragmented land-use area as the Câu River watershed, in northern Vietnam.

First, based on m-χ compact polarimetric decomposition, a dual-polarization radar vegetation index (RVI) was constructed. Then, based on Sentinel-1 data, the dynamic time warping (DTW) threshold classification method was used to extract rape planting areas in six counties in the main rape-producing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Finally, a random forest algorithm was used to analyze and screen the optimal time series combination of the extracted regional rape planting areas. Among the 94 rape samples obtained in the field, 74 samples were accurately classified as rape, and the overall accuracy was 78.72%. Six ground samples were used to verify the accuracy of the rape planting area extraction results, and the F-1 score was 81.00%.

The two accelerators are in the same tunnel and have the same radius R, for operation at BR=100 Tm and 200 Tm respectively. Superconducting magnets are necessary to reach the appropriate magnetic field and may considerably reduce the investment and operating costs, in comparison with conventional magnets. An R&D program was initiated to develop dipole magnets with maximum fields of 2 and 4 Tesla and dipole ramp rates of 4 T/s and 1 T/s, respectively. These requirements were chosen to achieve high average beam intensities. The SIS 100 dipole is a window-frame Nuclotron-type dipole and is being developed in collaboration with JINR (Dubna, Russia). This magnet has been operated at 4 T/s up to a field of 2 Tesla. Reduced losses and improved magnetic field quality are required for the SIS 100 accelerator. In a separate collaboration with BNL (Upton, USA), the one coil layer cos/spl theta/-type RHIC arc dipole, originally designed for operation at 3.5 Tesla with a rather slow ramp rate of 0.042 T/s, will be upgraded for the SIS 200 accelerator to operate at a ramp rate of 1T/s, up to a field of 4 T. R&D for a 6 Tesla dipole was started in collaboration with IHEP (Protvino, Russia), to further increase the rigidity of the SIS 200 ring to 300 Tm. Alternative schemes have been investigated. Besides the synchrotrons, the planned facility will consist of several storage rings and the Super Fragment Separator (SFRS), which have mainly DC magnets with large apertures. NSCL (East Lansing, USA) prepared a feasibility study for these superconducting magnets. The main results of the R&D are presented.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2003.812660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211843","","Superconducting magnets;Accelerator magnets;Ion accelerators;Particle beams;Ion beams;Research and development;Collaboration;Synchrotrons;Magnetic fields;Superconducting devices","","14","","16","IEEE","15 Jul 2003","June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This unique ecosystem has many endangered endemic species, the remaining populations of which are isolated in a few remaining forest patches. The present research was undertaken with two goals; to find habitat suitable for the expansion of a forest reserve for an endangered primate [the golden-headed lion tamarin] and to examine the possibility of establishing sustainable agricultural practices in the region that would eliminate or reduce the need of further deforestation. The vegetation cover of an area near Bahia, Brazil was studied using recent Landsat multispectral images. This was not entirely successful due to inadequate spectral and spatial resolution. This agriculturally modified canopy, or cabruca, is unsuitable as tamarin habitat. Secondary forest and deforested areas were distinguishable to some extent. The authors suspected that the canopy modification of cabruca cultivation would, however, be discernable by an active sensor system with sufficiently long wavelength to penetrate the canopy and return backscatter information from larger canopy elements such as branches and tree boles. A second data gathering effort was much more successful as it culminated with the acquisitions of a previously archived Landsat Thematic Mapper image and new SAR images from the SIR-C/X-SAR mission flown in October 1994. These two datasets, when used together, allow distinction between previously confused classes and to have insights into not only canopy cover, but vegetation structure and biomass of a broad utility to biodiversity and conservation efforts.","","0-7803-2567-2","10.1109/IGARSS.1995.521786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=521786","","Optical sensors;Remote sensing;Vegetation mapping;Satellites;Biomedical optical imaging;Ecosystems;Multispectral imaging;Spatial resolution;Sensor systems;Backscatter","","2","","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","10-14 July 1995","10-14 July 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the bad matching vectors still exist after the Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio test and contaminate the derived motion fields, which need to be identified and filtered out. In this article, we propose two algorithms to eliminate such wrong matching vectors. The first employs the matching results derived by the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) method as the reference motion fields to evaluate such wrong matches. The second method employs the local spatial consistency presumption of sea ice motion fields. A Voronoi diagram is applied to slice the overlapping area of two SAR images into many fractions, and each fraction extends its size 50% outward to calculate the regional mean sea ice flow vector and standard deviation.

The feature vector is composed of local variance estimates of the smooth image and of the wavelet coefficients. The decomposition is performed at two scales and using images derived by polarimetric power synthesis at a set of polarization configurations. This set is chosen based on a priori-knowledge of the texturally optimal polarization states. Alternatively a complete and nonredundant representation of the full polarimetric information consisting of nine backscatter intensities is used. Feature reduction is achieved by an approximate solution of the Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) transform. A set of controlled experiments, based on Monte Carlo simulations, is set up to assess the performance of the technique with respect to texture segmentation problems. One case is reported concerning the simulation of a fragmented forest, where two vegetation classes with different structural characteristics are mixed.

In order to support program comprehension, we present an approach to detect code fragments where types of references are correlated within a family; nonetheless, these correlations are hidden behind the references' declarations.

Due to a recent discovery that sea clutter, the electromagnetic wave backscatter from a sea surface, is chaotic rather than purely random, computational intelligence techniques such as neural networks have been applied to reconstruct the chaotic dynamic of sea clutter. The reconstructed sea clutter dynamical system which usually takes the form of a nonlinear predictor does not only provide a model of the sea scattering phenomenon, but it can also be used to detect the existence of small targets such as fishing boats and small fragments of icebergs by observing abrupt changes in the prediction error. We applied a genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain an optimal reconstruction of sea clutter dynamic based on a radial basis function (RBF) neural network. This GA-RBF uses a hybrid approach that employes a GA to search for the optimum values of the following RBF parameters: centers, variance, and number of hidden nodes, and uses the least square method to determine the weights. It is shown here that if the functional form of an unknown nonlinear dynamical system can be represented exactly using an RBF net (i.e., no approximation error), this GA-RBF approach can reconstruct the exact dynamic from its time series measurements. In addition to the improved accuracy in modeling sea clutter dynamic, the GA-RBF is also shown to enhance the detectability of small objects embedded in the sea. Using real-life radar data that are collected in the east coast of Canada by two different radar systems: a ground-based radar and a satellite equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), we show that the GA-RBF network is a reliable detector for small surface targets in various sea conditions and is practical for real-life search and rescue, navigation, and surveillance applications.","1557-9603","","10.1109/7.993232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993232","","Object detection;Neural networks;Clutter;Radar detection;Radar applications;Spaceborne radar;Image reconstruction;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Synthetic aperture radar;Satellites","","91","","29","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","Jan. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ANN model was developed due to its ability to capture nonlinear relationships and make complex predictions about deforestation trends. Advanced image registration techniques, along with error correction protocols, enabled the timely generation of maps illustrating temporal changes in forest cover. These were incorporated into a multi-layered algorithm designed to predict areas most at risk of deforestation during the study period.

Two cylindrical reconfigurable antennas are presented which tune over a wide band and steer over a wide field of view: a 133 mm diameter antenna providing a realized gain (gain with mismatch) better than a dipole from 1 GHz to 3 GHz and a 75 mm diameter antenna demonstrating steering about a full hemisphere. These antennas are constructed using a modular approach out of a series of identical boards which act as antenna pixels - electrically small segments that can be turned on and off to affect the antenna pattern. Each pixel contains RF switches and contacts for control wires on each side of the board. By fragmenting the reconfigurable antenna into individual pixel boards, one can construct antennas of arbitrary size and shape, allowing implementations to be designed for more gain or for a smaller footprint. Additionally, we show a single antenna's ability to achieve distinct configurations that each maintain gain in a specified direction while forming a null at a different offset angle.","2474-2740","978-1-5386-3763-0","10.23919/AMTAP.2017.8123698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8123698","","Gain;Radio frequency;Directive antennas;Dipole antennas;Aperture antennas;Antenna measurements","","1","","7","","30 Nov 2017","15-20 Oct. 2017","15-20 Oct. 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these works usually inherit the nature-scene approaches directly and may not be robust for the PolSAR image segmentation task. The main limitations include single-type feature construction, weak feature consistency, and geometry-agnostic collection of scattering information. In this article, we present the DENet, a double-encoder network with feature refinement and region adaption for the terrain segmentation in PolSAR images. First, a double-encoder architecture is proposed to leverage the multitype information of PolSAR images, which can provide more discriminative features than the previous methods using the single-type feature. Second, considering that the polarization information has strong consistency over the category-identical regions, a polarization-guided refinement module is proposed to maintain the feature consistency in the PolSAR segmentation model. This design alleviates the phenomenon of incomplete and fragmented segmentation results. Third, in view of the rich targets’ characteristics in the scattering information, a region-adaptive convolution module is developed to facilitate the scattering information collected over the geometry-irregular regions. This design can improve the segmentation accuracy on the geometry-irregular regions. Extensive experiments are conducted on six PolSAR images to verify the effectiveness of the DENet. Compared with the previous works, our method achieves competitive performance.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3130174","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61725105,62076241,41801349,62101371); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624979","Deep neural networks;double encoder;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR);polarization-guided refinement;region-adaptive convolution;terrain segmentation","Image segmentation;Scattering;Feature extraction;Convolution;Task analysis;Covariance matrices;Sun","","12","","74","IEEE","23 Nov 2021","2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this process, coherent point (CP) selection and connection are two essential steps. Typically, CPs are initially connected using methods such as Delaunay triangulation, followed by the estimation of deformation parameters for each edge. However, the removal of low-quality edges often fragments the initial network into multiple subnetworks, and reliable deformation estimation requires reconnecting these subnetworks into a single, fully connected network. Despite its importance, this problem remains challenging and has not been fully addressed. In this article, we propose an efficient subnetwork connection method, termed KD-tree with iterative expansion (KDIE), which integrates a K-dimension (KD)-tree-based distance searching strategy with an iterative expansion scheme. KDIE efficiently identifies connection edges using the KD-tree and progressively extends the search distance (SD) up to the atmospheric correlation distance (ACD), thereby avoids missing any connectable subnetworks and preferentially connects nearly all subnetworks with short edges. Compared with the existing multilayer subnetwork connection (MLSC) method, two experiments concerning C-band Sentinel-1A images over a mountainous landscape and X-band TerraSAR-X images over an urban area demonstrate that KDIE connects 1.84% and 0.25% more CPs than the MLSC method, while reducing computational time to only 5%–8% of that required by the MLSC method.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2026.3654035","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFC3007202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42274047); Science and Technology Special Project of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China(grant numbers:A2520); Fundamental Research Funds from Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping(grant numbers:AR2408,AR2509); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11352969","Iterative expansion;K-dimension (KD)-tree;subnetwork connection;time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR)","Deformation;Reliability;Coherence;Iterative methods;Image edge detection;Estimation;Atmospheric modeling;Trees (botanical);Monitoring;Geoscience and remote sensing","","","","25","IEEE","15 Jan 2026","2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The land suitability assessment (LSA) is known as the basic scientific solution in this regard and has been widely used. This study takes a new approach to LSA based on the cultivated crops and their land production potential (LPP). The Honam region of Lorestan Province in western Iran was selected as a case study, where various plants including orchards and crop types (e.g., rainfed wheat, irrigated wheat, barley, chickpea, alfalfa, clover, and garlic) were cultivated. A map of crop types was first produced using the time series of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar and Sentinel-2 optical imagery in the context of a feature-level fusion classification approach based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The LSA was then performed using the Food and Agriculture Organization method, and the LPP for plants was estimated using climate, soil, and landscape requirements. The SVM-derived crop type map gave acceptable performance with an overall accuracy of 92% and 86% kappa coefficient. Meanwhile, the clover and alfalfa had the highest (96%) and lowest (66%) accuracy, respectively. The LSA showed that slope, temperature, and soil physical properties such as texture, structure, and coarse fragments resulted in a significant reduction in LPP compared to potential yield. These limitations lowered the land suitability for chickpea, wheat, and garlic and made the land unsuitable for chickpea. Despite the limitations, over 60% of the studied lands for alfalfa, clover, barley, and wheat were in the suitable and moderately suitable classes.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3437689","Soil and Water Research Institute of Iran(grant numbers:014-10-10-9452); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10653750","Crop type mapping;land production potential (LPP);land suitability assessment (LSA);remote sensing;sentinel imagery","Crops;Soil;Optical imaging;Production;Optical sensors;Adaptive optics;Sentinel-1","","3","","50","CCBYNCND","27 Aug 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previously, we reported an adaptive nonlinear visualization system based on a complex-valued self-organizing map (CSOM) that deals with complex amplitude texture in reflection images at multiple frequencies. The system distinguishes landmines from clutter by paying attention to textural features obtained by high spatial resolution and wideband reflection measurement. Because the system employed a mechanical scan of a pair of horn antennas, the measurement required a long time. An array antenna can reduce the time. The antenna element to be used there should therefore be compact and wideband. This paper reports the design and fabrication of a walled LTSA array visualization system. The antenna element has a 14 times 28 mm aperture size, and works at the 8-12 GHz frequency band. Because the structure is a simple combination of glass epoxy substrates and metal plates, we can easily fabricate low-cost and lightweight arrays. Electrical switches realize a high-speed scanning of 12 times 12 = 144 elements in total. We also report the results of a visualization experiment, in which plastic landmines are clearly visualized with the array in combination with the adaptive CSOM processing. Detection of landmines at frequencies of 10 GHz is only likely to be possible for targets buried a few centimeter deep or where the soil attenuation is very low. This might be a severe limitation of applicability of the method, as in field conditions soil attenuations of 10 dB or considerably more are commonly encountered, requiring the radar to operate at frequencies below 2-3 GHz. The best solution may be a multisensor system comprising these complementary high- and low-frequency radars.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.897418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276893","Complex-valued self-organizing map (CSOM);ground-penetrating radar (GPR);linearly tapered slot antenna (LTSA);plastic landmine","Phased arrays;Spatial resolution;High-resolution imaging;Visualization;Plastics;Landmine detection;Frequency;Linear antenna arrays;Optical reflection;Antenna measurements","","47","","22","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We find eight galaxies and one star with (i′−z′) > 1.5 to a depth of z′AB= 25.6 (an 8σ detection in each of the 3 available ACS epochs). This corresponds to an unobscured star formation rate of ≈15 h−270 M⊙ yr−1 at z= 5.9, equivalent to L* for the Lyman-break population at z= 3–4 (ΩΛ= 0.7, ΩM= 0.3). We are sensitive to star-forming galaxies at 5.6 ≲z≲ 7.0 with an effective comoving volume of ≈1.8 × 105h−370 Mpc3 after accounting for incompleteness at the higher redshifts due to luminosity bias. This volume should encompass the primeval subgalactic-scale fragments of the progenitors of about a thousand L* galaxies at the current epoch. We determine a volume-averaged global star formation rate of (6.7 ± 2.7) × 10−4h70 M⊙ yr−1 Mpc−3 at z∼ 6 from rest-frame UV selected starbursts at the bright end of the luminosity function: this is a lower limit because of dust obscuration and galaxies below our sensitivity limit. This measurement shows that at z∼ 6 the star formation density at the bright end is a factor of ∼6 times less than that determined by Steidel et al. for a comparable sample of UV-selected galaxies at z= 3–4, and so extends our knowledge of the star formation history of the Universe to earlier times than previous work and into the epoch where reionization may have occurred.","1365-2966","","10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.06546.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8148676","surveys;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: formation;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: starburst;ultraviolet: galaxies","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","June 2003","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Due to the stringent Quality of Service requirement of those applications, IEEE 802.11ad/ay have introduced contention free channel access called Service Period. One type of user traffic supported by IEEE 802.11ad is isochronous traffic, which is essentially periodic traffic that requires certain channel time to be allocated before its period ends. In an earlier work, we presented three Admission Control Algorithms (ACAs) which admit isochronous requests to achieve the above goals. One of these ACAs, the proportional fair allocation admission control (PFAAC), offers the best tradeoff across different performance metrics. But it did not consider guard time (GT) overhead, which is essential in a practical system. In this paper, we present two methods to compute upper bounds on GT overhead. We evaluate performance of the modified PFAAC with the two methods and PFAAC with no GT overhead. The modified PFAAC with the method that uses a tighter upper bound on GT overhead, provides the best performance.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2022.3207969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9896870","IEEE 802.11ad;admission control;isochronous traffic;guard time;scheduling;medium access control (MAC)","Interference;Gallium arsenide;Bandwidth;Performance evaluation;Wireless communication;Synthetic aperture sonar;Media Access Protocol","","3","","22","IEEE","21 Sep 2022","Dec. 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The geometric focus of these transducers limits the treatment envelope to the center of the brain, whereas the majority of cancers, especially metastases, occur along the periphery of the brain. In addition, these transducers create waves that impinge perpendicularly on the skull, which is inefficient. A normal incident transmission also sets up standing waves in the skull, which along with high attenuation leads to excess heating and a requirement for active cooling. We have developed an array of ultrasound wedge transducers capable of efficiently delivering focused ultrasound energy into the brain with minimal heating of the skull and the ability to address regions in the brain that are close to or far from the skull.","1948-5727","978-1-5386-3383-0","10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8092792","","Skull;Transducers;Ultrasonic imaging;Attenuation;Heating systems;Cancer;Tumors","","5","","","IEEE","2 Nov 2017","6-9 Sept. 2017","6-9 Sept. 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Photofragment imaging applied to atmospheric photochemistry","J. A. Syage","Aerosp. Corp., Los Angeles, CA, USA",Summaries of Papers Presented at the Quantum Electronics and Laser Science Conference,"6 Aug 2002","1996","","","138","","Summary form only given. The author reports his progress in developing a photofragment imaging technique to record state-resolved angle-velocity distributions of photofragments from excitation of molecules and clusters. The technique is similar in spirit to the landmark method of photofragment imaging developed by Chandler and Houston (1987). These investigators record 2D projections of 3D angle-velocity distributions on an intensified CCD camera, which they invert by Abel transformation to obtain the angle-velocity resolved differential cross sections. The author's technique is based on rastering a 3D ion packet across a detection aperture and measuring 1D TOF spectra at each position to define a 2D image. In so doing, a sectional or planar image is collected rather than a projection. This eliminates the need to carry out an inversion to obtain the angle-velocity resolved differential cross sections. Measurements were made of O(/sup 3/P/sub 1/) recoil from photodissociation of the molecule O/sub 3/ and the van der Waals complex O/sub 3/-H/sub 2/O. The spin allowed reaction channel for gas-phase O/sub 3/ photodissociation is O/sub 3//spl rarr/ O(/sup 3/P/sub 1/)+O/sub 2/(X/sup 3//spl Sigma//sub g//sup -/). A 2D image for 226 nm photolysis is presented. In these results the pump and probe excitation are from the same 5-ns laser pulse. O(/sup 3/P/sub 0,1,2/) fragments were ionized by 2+1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization through a two-photon transition. An anisotropic bimodal velocity distribution is clearly evident. The two peaks in the velocity distribution correspond to vibrational excitation in O/sub 2/(X) peaking at v=15 and v=27. The latter result is important for stratospheric O/sub 3/ chemistry.","","1-55752-444-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=865676","","Photochemistry;Laser excitation;Charge coupled devices;Charge-coupled image sensors;Apertures;Position measurement;Probes;Laser transitions;Pump lasers;Optical pulses","","","","7","","6 Aug 2002","7-7 June 1996","7-7 June 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current methods face challenges in maintaining geometric consistency, particularly when dealing with large objects, resulting in fragmented segmentation masks. We propose a Mamba-diffusion framework to preserve geometric consistency in segmentation masks. This framework preserves geometric consistency by introducing a generative diffusion-based semantic segmentation pipeline and developing a Mamba-based multimodal fusion model. The fusion model fuses the multimodal images in multiple scales and scanning mechanisms by a double cross-fusion (DCF) module. Then, the cross-modal information is further integrated by a dual-splitting structured state-space (DS-S4) model. Finally, the diffusion-based segmentation pipeline predicts semantic masks by progressively refining random Gaussian noise, guided by fused multimodal features. Our experimental results, verified on WHU-OPT-SAR and Hunan datasets, demonstrate that the proposed framework surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a considerable margin.

Then, in order to separate the targets and the background automatically, a threshold segmentation algorithm, called maximizing the Tsallis entropy, is applied.

TWA arose directly from antenna concept with an inherent ground plane, while CSA and FA evolved from scattering technology. TWA is much thinner and lighter than CSA and FA, roughly by a factor o 5 and 15, respectively.

The thresholds essential to make a decision about the class are found via the procedure of automatic splitting of Gaussian distributions mixture. The results of clustering of radar data received by the full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar PALSAR-2 of Japanese satellite ALOS-2 launched in 2014 are presented. Classification accuracy is estimated with the image fragments which represent the generalized surface classes of 'water' and 'not water'.

Several pre-USArray local seismic studies showed how the characteristics of key geological features such as the Colorado Plateau and the Yellowstone Snake River Plains are linked to their deep mantle structure. Recent body-wave models based on the deployment of the high density, large aperture USArray have provided far more details on the mantle structure while surface-wave tomography (ballistic waves and noise correlations) informs us on the shallow structure. Here we combine constraints from these two data sets to image and study the link between the geology of the western United States, the shallow structure of the Earth and the convective processes in mantle. Our multiphase DNA10-S model provides new constraints on the extent of the Archean lithosphere imaged as a large, deeply rooted fast body that encompasses the stable Great Plains and a large portion of the Northern and Central Rocky Mountains. Widespread slow anomalies are found in the lower crust and upper mantle, suggesting that low-density rocks isostatically sustain part of the high topography of the western United States. The Yellowstone anomaly is imaged as a large slow body rising from the lower mantle, intruding the overlying lithosphere and controlling locally the seismicity and the topography. The large E–W extent of the USArray used in this study allows imaging the ‘slab graveyard’, a sequence of Farallon fragments aligned with the currently subducting Juan de Fuca Slab, north of the Mendocino Triple Junction. The lithospheric root of the Colorado Plateau has apparently been weakened and partly removed through dripping. The distribution of the slower regions around the Colorado Plateau and other rigid blocks follows closely the trend of Cenozoic volcanic fields and ancient lithospheric sutures, suggesting that the later exert a control on the locus of magmato-tectonic activity today.

The radial proper motion of these features, ≃15 km s−1, are found to be consistent with the AGB wind and their linear sizes and interlapse times (500–1900 yr) also agree with those found around AGB stars, suggesting a common origin. We find evidence using radiative-hydrodynamic simulations that regular patterns produced at the end of the AGB phase become highly distorted by their interactions with the expanding PN and the anisotropic illumination and ionization patterns caused by shadow instabilities. These processes will disrupt the regular (mostly spiral) patterns around AGB stars, plausibly becoming the arcs and fragmented rings observed in the haloes of PNe.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/staa1225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267331","stars: evolution;stars: winds, outflows;planetary nebulae: individual: AFGL 3068;planetary nebulae: individual: NGC 6543;planetary nebulae: individual: NGC 7009;planetary nebulae: individual: NGC 7027","","","","","","","23 Nov 2020","Feb. 2020","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Existing sea ice boundary detection efforts are primarily based on satellite observations, which are limited in spatial and temporal resolution. This study addresses this limitation by presenting the first Arctic application of shipborne global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) for real-time detection of sea ice transition zones. The method passively receives L1-band GNSS signals reflected from the sea surface, using power fluctuations—linked to changes in surface dielectric properties—as indicators of ice–water transitions. Two field experiments aboard the Chinese icebreaker Xuelong 2 demonstrate that GNSS-R can stably and repeatedly capture transition zone signatures with minute-level temporal resolution. Within each ~1 km experimental track, the retrieved sea ice concentration time series quantitatively reflects fluctuations corresponding to an effective spatial resolution of approximately 31 m, thereby enabling the detection of distinct signal characteristics between continuous ice edges and fragmented ice. Synchronized onboard video provides independent validation, showing overall detection accuracies exceeding 80%. This work establishes GNSS-R as a low-cost, passive, and high-resolution technique for operational monitoring of sea ice transition zones, supporting safer navigation and improved understanding of polar processes.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2025.3645706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11303216","Arctic;GNSS reflectometry;polar regions;sea ice transition zones","Sea ice;Ice;Global navigation satellite system;Sea surface;Videos;Arctic;Reflector antennas;Monitoring;Spatial resolution;Permittivity","","","","15","IEEE","17 Dec 2025","2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed antenna array comprises four element structure arranged in 2x2 layout. A corporate feed network is used to feed the input signals to the antenna elements. The array designed to resonates at 11.7 GHz but provides a wide bandwidth around 4 GHz. The antenna array was first theoretically designed, simulated and analyzed to investigate its performance characteristics. The antenna array was then fabricated and measured in order to verify the resulted performance parameters with the proposed simulated design. The array is aimed to be used as a core design sub-unit to form higher order arrays, which can be deployed in satellite applications as its bandwidth covers a considerable fragment of the Ku-band up to 14 GHz. The designed antenna array is easily scalable to provide a reliable performance at other frequency bands to serve numerous applications. An expansion to form higher order arrays is also possible providing that the feed network is redesigned to insure a matched distribution of the feed signals to the new array elements and layout.","","978-1-6654-6948-7","10.1109/TSP55681.2022.9851393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9851393","Microstrip Antenna Array;Aperture Coupling;Dual Polarization;Ku-Band;Matched Feed Network;Rohacell;Wideband","Antenna measurements;Microstrip antenna arrays;Satellite antennas;Satellites;Array signal processing;Microstrip antennas;Antenna feeds","","1","","17","IEEE","18 Aug 2022","13-15 July 2022","13-15 July 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our previous work with a neuronavigation-guided FUS system, only part of the cavitation signal could be monitored in real time due to the computational burden although full-burst analysis is required to detect transient and stochastic cavitation activity. In addition, the spatial resolution of PAM can be limited for a small-aperture receiving array transducer. For full-burst real-time PAM with enhanced resolution, we developed a parallel processing scheme for coherence-factor-based PAM (CF-PAM) and implemented it onto the neuronavigation-guided FUS system using a co-axial phased-array imaging transducer. Methods: Simulation and in-vitro human skull studies were conducted for the performance evaluation of the proposed method in terms of spatial resolution and processing speed. We also carried out real-time cavitation mapping during BBB opening in non-human primates (NHPs). Results: CF-PAM with the proposed processing scheme provided better resolution than that of traditional time-exposure-acoustics PAM with a higher processing speed than that of eigenspace-based robust Capon beamformer, which facilitated the full-burst PAM with the integration time of 10 ms at a rate of 2 Hz. In vivo feasibility of PAM with the co-axial imaging transducer was also demonstrated in two NHPs, showing the advantages of using real-time B-mode and full-burst PAM for accurate targeting and safe treatment monitoring. Significance: This full-burst PAM with enhanced resolution will facilitate the clinical translation of online cavitation monitoring for safe and efficient BBB opening.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2023.3266952","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01AG038961,R01EB009041,R01EB029338); Focused Ultrasound Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10122125","Cavitation mapping;focused ultrasound therapy;parallel processing;passive acoustic mapping","Transducers;Monitoring;Imaging;Graphics processing units;Real-time systems;Spatial resolution;Instruction sets","Animals;Blood-Brain Barrier;Neuronavigation;Acoustics;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonic Therapy;Microbubbles","32","","68","IEEE","9 May 2023","Oct. 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Long-term time series analysis makes it possible to reconstruct the forest history and perform a multitemporal analysis on the cause and effect of changes. This paper describes an approach for successional stage classification in a tropical forest based on vertical structure variations. Stereo-photogrammetry and novel image matching methods are used to produce dense digital surface models (DSMs) from optical images (historical and contemporary). An approach was developed to classify the successional stages of trees using local height variations provided by a DSM and image intensity values. Experiments were performed in a semi-deciduous tropical forest fragment located in the West of São Paulo State, Brazil. Six test sample plots and a line transect were established and field surveys were conducted to collect forest variables. These variables were used to characterize and validate five successional classes based on secondary tree species that stratify the forest canopy. The current status of the entire forest fragment was characterized using recent photogrammetric imagery, and a map of historical successional stages was established by analyzing the historical photogrammetric imagery. The investigation demonstrated that the proposed technique can be used to reconstruct the geometric structure of a forest canopy from aerial images. The successional stages can be identified and compared over time using multitemporal photogrammetric imagery and DSMs, which enables an analysis of forest cover changes. The results indicated that the successional stage has changed dramatically during the 50 years period of time.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2606320","São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(grant numbers:2012/23259-9,2013/50426-4,2014/05033-7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572061","Forestry;image texture analysis;photography;remote sensing;vegetation mapping","Remote sensing;Vegetation mapping;Laser radar;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Vegetation;Image reconstruction","","18","","48","IEEE","20 Sep 2016","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, applying state-of-the-art foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to rural contexts produces severely fragmented outputs, with single buildings often split into multiple segments, rendering them unsuitable for operational mapping. This study introduces the Multi-Resolution Region Merging (MRRM) framework, a novel training-free post-processing approach that transforms fragmented SAM outputs into cartographically accurate building footprints. MRRM uniquely leverages complementary information from two spatial resolutions—detailed 10 cm segmentation for geometric precision and generalized 25 cm boundaries for object coherence—through a systematic region merging strategy. Systematic parameter optimization across Indonesian rural settlements identified optimal configurations (60 cm buffer distance, 0.1 m simplification tolerance) that achieved consistently high spatial accuracy (mean IoU >0.83). Stratified evaluation across nine morphological categories demonstrated substantial fragmentation reduction (up to 50.2%) while improving segmentation accuracy ( $\Delta $  IoU up to 0.0478), particularly in dense and semi-regular building configurations. Comparative analysis against four established post-processing methods revealed MRRM’s superior performance, achieving the highest IoU (95.9%) and lowest shape distortion (SCD = 1.5%) while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework’s training-free nature and compatibility with existing GIS workflows make it immediately deployable for large-scale rural mapping initiatives, particularly in data-scarce regions where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3608800","Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology (FITB), Institut Teknologi Bandung, through the PPMI FITB 2025 Research Program(grant numbers:FITB.PPMI-1-10-2025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11159187","Building segmentation;region merging;rural mapping;shape regularity","Buildings;Image segmentation;Merging;Accuracy;Shape;Systematics;Geospatial analysis;Training;Image edge detection;Geometry","","","","35","CCBY","11 Sep 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, Non-Functional Requirements considered to be more important than Functional Requirements and can determine the success of the software system. Non-Functional Requirements can be very complicated to understand due to their subjective manner and especially their conflicting nature. Many approaches and techniques have been introduced to manage the conflicts between multiple Non-functional Requirements and to analyze the trade-off in costs and benefits between the alternative solutions that satisfy them. (Problem) Self-Adaptive Systems tends to change its behavior and configurations due to the changes in its environment. Current solutions might not be suitable for the current situations, because current approaches managing Non-Functional Requirements trade-off stops managing them during the system runtime. (Approach and Objective) In this paper, we investigated the trade-offs between multiple Non-Functional Requirements in Self-Adaptive Systems. We fragmentized the NonFunctional Requirements and its alternative solutions in form of Multi-entity Bayesian network fragments. As a result, when changes occur, our system creates a situation specific Bayesian network to measure the impact of the system's conditions and environmental changes on the Non-Functional Requirements satisfaction. Furthermore, it dynamically decides which alternative solution is suitable for the current situation.","","978-1-5386-8410-8","10.1109/RESACS.2018.00007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8501473","Goal model;Non Functional Requirements trade-off;Multi-entity Bayesian network;Self-Adaptive Systems;Uncertainty","Bayes methods;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty;Monitoring;Synthetic aperture sonar;Random variables;Software","","7","","26","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","20-20 Aug. 2018","20-20 Aug. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thresholding on ensemble coherence is a common practice for identifying radar scatterers that are less affected by decorrelation noise. Thresholding on coherence might, however, cause loss of information over the areas undergoing more complex deformation scenarios. If the discrepancies in the areas of moderate coherence share similar behavior, it appears important to take into account their spatial correlation for correct inference. The information over low-coherent areas might then be used in a similar way the coherence is used in thematic mapping applications such as change detection. We propose an approach based on data mining and statistical procedures for mitigating the impact of outliers in MTI results. Our approach allows for minimization of outliers in final results while preserving spatial and statistical dependence among observations. Tests from monitoring slope failures and undermined areas performed in this work have shown that this is beneficial: 1) for better evaluation of low-coherent scatterers that are commonly discarded by the standard thresholding procedure, 2) for tackling outlying observations with extremes in any variable, 3) for improving spatial densities of standard persistent scatterers, 4) for the evaluation of areas undergoing more complex deformation scenarios, and 5) for the visualization purposes.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2686646","Slovak Grant Agency VEGA(grant numbers:1/0714/15,1/0462/16); Portuguese FCT(grant numbers:UID/AGR/04033/2013,POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006958); DLR(grant numbers:LAN2833); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7895168","Data mining;InSAR;multivariate analysis;outlier detection","Coherence;Principal component analysis;Data mining;Graphical user interfaces;Earth;Remote sensing;Reliability","","17","","39","IEEE","10 Apr 2017","June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, detailed characterization of forest soil organic horizons is of paramount importance for ecological studies and for carbon cycle and global changerelated studies. Ultrawideband ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data acquired above beech forest litter were used to analyze the effects of litter on the backscattering and investigate the ability of GPR to quantitatively characterize the properties of the forest floor. Radar measurements were performed over different litter configurations (i.e., single layers of recently fallen litter (OL) or of fragmented litter (OF), and combined OL-OF layers) and thicknesses. Radar data were processed through full-wave inversion. Over the considered frequency range (0.8-4.0 GHz), attenuation of the radar signal increased as both frequency and litter thickness increase, due to scattering and dielectric losses. These effects were accounted for in the radar model through frequency dependence of litter apparent electrical conductivity. Good agreement (RMSE = 9.5 × 10-3 m) was observed between estimated and measured litter thicknesses. Radar data inversions provided reliable estimates of litter electromagnetic properties, with relative dielectric permittivity values around 1.2 and 3.9 for OL and OF litters, respectively, and corresponding values of 0.032 and 0.080 Sm-1 for litter apparent electrical conductivity at 4.0 GHz.

While this technological convergence has brought numerous advantages, it has also introduced a new vector of cybersecurity threats to both traditional satellite infrastructure and novel small-satellite architectures. Owing to their broadcast nature and extensive coverage area, satellite signals are inherently susceptible to jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping, rendering them appealing targets for malicious actors. Moreover, satellites operate under power, computational, and bandwidth limits, which restrict the implementation of resource-intensive security measures. Therefore, it is necessary to develop robust and lightweight security frameworks capable of countering threats across multiple orbital domains, communication protocols, and network integration points. This paper presents a hybrid research contribution that combines a systematic survey of key cyber threats with novel conceptual and practical security frameworks for satellite communication (SATCOMs) networks. It weaves threats, defenses, and governance into a coherent scaffold that follows the entire SATCOM stack–space, ground, and user–across all orbits. Unlike most previous studies–which treat countermeasures in a fragmented manner with limited synergy across layers–this study presents cyber threats using the confidentiality-integrity-availability (CIA) triad and presents a multilayered security framework that combines physical-layer hardening, quantum-resilient encryption, and AI-driven analytics, supported by a governance framework aligned with standards, within one integrated workflow. The undertaken approach uniquely addresses prevention, defense, resilience, and collaboration through detailed countermeasures. This bridges the gap between isolated security solutions and the interconnected nature of modern SATCOM ecosystems. The analysis of the research reveals that prioritizing lightweight AI, quantum resilience, and cross-layer security by real-world SATCOM operators and agencies is critical for securing next-generation SATCOMs against sophisticated cyber-attacks. Moreover, the convergence of SATCOMs with 5G/6G, AI, and quantum technologies requires interdisciplinary research to address the interoperability, scalability, and ever-increasing cyber threats in SATCOMs.","2644-125X","","10.1109/OJCOMS.2025.3585060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11062651","Satellite communications (SATCOM);cybersecurity;cryptographic methods;satellite jamming;spoofing","Security;Satellite broadcasting;Computer security;Cryptography;Space vehicles;Jamming;Encryption;Satellites;Resilience;Extraterrestrial measurements","","3","","190","CCBY","1 Jul 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We find some discrepancies with the predictions of the former model. Furthermore, the image of the DLA galaxy towards Q 2206−1958 shows a complex disturbed morphology, which is more in accord with the hierarchical picture. We use the properties of the rest-frame optical emission lines to further explore the question posed by Møller et al.: are high-redshift DLA galaxies Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) selected by gas cross-section? The measured velocity dispersions of the DLA galaxies are in agreement with this picture, while the data on the [O iii] luminosities and the velocity differences between the Lyα and [O iii] lines are inconclusive, as there are insufficient LBG measurements overlapping in luminosity. Finally, we estimate the star formation rates in these two DLA galaxies, using a variety of diagnostics, and include a discussion of the extent to which the [O iii] line is useful for this purpose.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.08838.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8173498","galaxies: formation;galaxies: high redshift;galaxies: kinematics and dynamics;quasars: absorption lines;quasars: individual: Q 2206−1958;quasars: individual: Q 2233.9+1381","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","April 2005","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Spitzer Infrared Array Camera ratio maps reveal that the bubble is traced by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission following an almost circular morphology except in the south-west direction towards the low molecular density environment. The observational signatures of the collected molecular and cold dust material have been found around the bubble. We have detected 418 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the selected region around the bubble N14. Interestingly, the detected YSO clusters are associated with the collected molecular and cold dust material at the borders of the bubble. One of the clusters is found with deeply embedded intermediate mass and massive Class I YSOs associated with one of the dense dust clumps in the east of the bubble N14. We do not find good agreement between the dynamical age of the H II region and the fragmentation time of the accumulated molecular materials to explain the possible ‘collect-and-collapse’ process around the bubble N14. Therefore, we suggest the possibility of triggered star formation by compression of the pre-existing dense clumps by the shock wave and/or small-scale Jeans gravitational instabilities in the collected materials. We have also investigated 5 young massive embedded protostars (8–10 M⊙) and 15 intermediate mass (3–7 M⊙) Class I YSOs which are associated with the dust and molecular fragmented clumps at the borders of the bubble. We conclude that the expansion of the H II region is also leading to the formation of these intermediate and massive Class I YSOs around the bubble N14.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/sts430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8180603","stars: formation;stars: pre-main-sequence;ISM: bubbles;dust, extinction;H II regions;ISM: individual objects (IRAS 18134−1652)","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","Feb. 2013","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Passive microwave remote sensing is a powerful tool for large-scale continuous snow depth (SD) monitoring, yet the low spatial resolution and saturation limitation of brightness temperature (TB) make it difficult for a single passive microwave dataset to address the challenges posed by the complex topography and fragmented snow distribution on the TP. To address this issue, an area-to-point downscaled daily SD retrieval method that accounts for spatial heterogeneity was proposed in this study using multimodal remote sensing data. First, we developed a new algorithm to reconstruct the high-resolution TB from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), considering the effects of snow and land cover types. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select the optimal subset of features, including active and passive remote sensing information, meteorological data, and geographic factors, and then a multimodal feature-driven convolutional neural network (CNN)–long short-term memory network (LSTM) was used to retrieve daily 500-m SD data. The method effectively captures the dynamic spatial variation features of SD. The validation of the proposed TB reconstruction downscaling method using the enhanced-resolution TB data showed the RMSE ranged from 2.65 to 6.81 K at different frequencies. The contribution of multimodal features was analyzed based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Snow cover accumulation (SCA), H-pol TB at 89 GHz, and latitude were key features, although the relative contributions of these features varied significantly across different environments. In the site-based independent validation, the RMSE of the proposed method was 2.33 cm, demonstrating better accuracy than existing SD retrieval methods in the TP. The use of multimodal features improved accuracy by 1.67 cm (41.7%) compared to passive microwave features only. The proposed SD retrieval algorithm can obtain high-resolution and high-precision SD information, thereby supporting water resource management and climate change monitoring over the TP.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2026.3653456","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42422106); Key Research and Development Program of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2022B01011-1); Moganshan Geospatial Information Laboratory; National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0605403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11347059","Brightness temperature downscaling;deep learning;multimodal feature;snow depth (SD) retrieval;super-resolution","Snow;Microwave theory and techniques;Land surface;Forests;Spatial resolution;Grasslands;Accuracy;Microwave radiometry;Monitoring;Electromagnetic heating","","","","64","IEEE","12 Jan 2026","2026","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The spectrometer is moved in vacuum, and local ratios of the fragment ions are measured by extracting the ions through small holes which are made on the wall separating the plasma and the spectrometer room. The experiment was carried out with CF/sub 4/ as the source material. The results suggest that the ion-species distributions are not consistent with the electron-density distribution.

The identification of fragmentation has been based on a detailed interpretation, based on radio science, of head- and trail-echo properties. We now extend the discussion of fragmenting meteoroids to include apparent high-altitude (130–180 km) meteors observed at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO). While there have been a few reports of high-altitude meteors observed both optically and with radar, the meteor radar community has remained sceptical, with suspicions of antenna side-lobe contamination being the most commonly raised objection. We report results from two sets of meteor observations carried out at JRO in 2010 April. Our findings include meteoroid fragmentation results that are similar to those from the Arecibo VHF radar. These findings lead to the conclusions that fragmentation is not only observed at the JRO but that k⊥B scattering adds an interesting additional radio science dimension to the issue. We also report on apparent high-altitude meteor events that, if ultimately confirmed, offer insight into sputtering as a source of the meteor ionization, and perhaps indicate the unique importance of magnetic field geometry in these head-echo observations. Also, new, apparently high-altitude transient events, likely related to the meteoroid flux, have been identified. In presenting these results, we note our careful calibration of the JRO radar, utilizing satellite returns in order to largely, if not totally, exclude side-lobe contamination and other possible error sources, as reported in our companion paper.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stu2176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8196182","techniques: radar astronomy;meteorites;meteors;meteoroids","","","2","","","","19 Jan 2018","Feb. 2015","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In response to the demands of modern multi-system communication and indoor environments, omnidirectional antennas with broad bandwidth, miniaturization, and low profile have become a research hotspot in recent years. This report mainly introduces three types of omnidirectional antennas for indoor mobile base station. Firstly, an ultrawideband omnidirectional patch antenna with vertical polarization and low profile is introduced. It composes of a circular patch, eight short pins and a circular ground plane. Two propagation modes of TM01 and TM02 are produced when the circular patch is excited by a 1-to-8 power divider, while other two propagation modes of TM01 and TM02 are additionally excited by embedding two ring slots in the ground plane. A circular slot is then loaded in the circular patch to enhance the impedance matching at the higher frequency band, thus widening the operating bandwidth. By using such a new mechanism, the multiple modes are combined to realize good impedance matching and omnidirectional radiation with vertical polarization during an ultrawide bandwidth of 110% (1.57-5.39 GHz). Secondly, a horizontal-polarized omnidirectional antenna with an extremely wide bandwidth and small gain variation is proposed. To attain horizontal-polarized omnidirectional performance and small size, eight shared dipoles, which are round-connected into an octagon-shaped array, are excited by a 1-to-8 power divider. To significantly improve the impedance matching and omnidirectional performance over a very broad operating frequency band, fragmented metal strips are introduced around the shared dipoles. In the proposed design, a desirable bandwidth of 92.3% (1.4−3.8 GHz) is obtained under a compact size of π × (0.32 λL)2 × 0.01 λL. Apart from that, the wideband antenna also attains excellent gain variation of smaller than 1.5 dB at the operating band. Finally, an effective design method for an aperture-shared broadband dual-polarized omnidirectional antenna with a very low profile is introduced. An ultra-low-profile verticalpolarized omnidirectional antenna is realized by utilizing a 1- to-4 power divider to excite a metal disk with four fan-shaped slots, which is located upon a circular reflector and connected to the reflector by twelve identical metal pillars. Then a horizontal-polarized omnidirectional element, which is designed based on an 8-unit dipole array, is fed by a broadband 1-to-8 power divider. To attain an aperture-shared dual-polarized antenna, the reflector of the vertical-polarized antenna is replaced by the horizontal-polarized element. In this innovative scheme, the dual-polarized omnidirectional antenna achieves a wide co-frequency bandwidth of 95% (1.6−4.5 GHz) and an ultra-low profile of about 0.05λL.","2994-3124","979-8-3503-8996-8","10.1109/ICMMT61774.2024.10671989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10671989","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jan 2026","16-19 May 2024","16-19 May 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the five STQ's on the first stage of the BigRIPS are cooled by a liquid helium cryogenic plant, the nine STQ's on the second stage are cooled by small cryocoolers on their cryostat. This first stage serves to produce and separate RI beams, so that the first two STQs are exposed to the high radiation from the production target and beam dumps, which causes radiation heat loads as well as radiation damages. Measurements of the radiation heat loads to the cryostats of the first two STQs during commissioning operations of the RIBF facility are reported.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2010.2098384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5688195","Accelerator magnets;liquid-helium cryogenic system;particle beam focusing superconducting magnets","Heating;Helium;Load modeling;Cryogenics;Isotopes;Particle separators;Superconducting magnets","","5","","11","IEEE","13 Jan 2011","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The practical implementation of special directional patterns based on aperture and, in particular, mirror antennas entails transforming the mirror profile, which can result in extremely complex configurations. At the same time, in a mirror antenna with a comb reflector, making a special directional pattern requires the correct choice of the groove depths that are short-circuited slits by the form and are periodically placed in the conducting screen. To synthesize a cosecant directional pattern based on an antenna with a comb reflector, the authoring computational algorithm is applied. The algorithm includes the interpolation of the amplitude-phase front of the electromagnetic wave produced by the antenna feed by the locally flat fragments and the use of a strict solution to the problem of screen slit diffraction of a plane wave with a bounded front in space. To determine the groove depths, a genetic algorithm and a criterion for the minimum standard deviation of the calculated directional pattern from the expected one are used. The results of the synthesis of a cosecant directional pattern in a wide angular sector based on an antenna with an optimized comb reflector are presented.","","978-1-6654-1345-9","10.1109/ICFSP53514.2021.9646425","RFBR; CNRS(grant numbers:20-51-15001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646425","mirror antenna;comb reflector;cosecant directional pattern;synthesis;computational algorithm;wave diffraction","Interpolation;Diffraction;Shape;Signal processing algorithms;Directive antennas;Signal processing;Reflector antennas","","1","","11","IEEE","23 Dec 2021","9-11 Sept. 2021","9-11 Sept. 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The antenna was designed using a genetic algorithm, employing the fragmented aperture technique; measured and modeled data will be presented. The attached lab space is air conditioned and provisioned for rack mounted equipment. The structure uses a modified 20' Conex shipping container where an entire sidewall has been replaced with a reinforced composite radome for the antennas. The overall mechanical frame design included a Finite Element Analysis to ensure structural integrity. The system is intended for long-term standalone use as an outdoor measurement radar system but can be moved using standard shipping container methods.

Such echoes are detected by high power, large aperture (HPLA) radars. Frequently such detections show large variations in signal strength that suggest constructive and destructive interference. Using the ARPA Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR) we can also observe the polarization of the returns. Usually, scatter from head echoes resembles scatter from a small sphere; when transmitting right circular polarization (RC), the received signal consists entirely of left circular polarization (LC). For some detections, power is also received in the RC channel, which indicates the presence of a more complicated scattering process. Radar returns of a fragmenting meteoroid are simulated using a hard-sphere scattering model numerically evaluated in the resonant region of Mie scatter. The cross- and co-polar scattering cross-sections are computed for pairs of spheres lying within a few wavelengths, simulating the earliest stages of fragmentation upon atmospheric impact. The likelihood of detecting this sort of idealized fragmentation event is small, but this demonstrates the measurements that would result from such an event would display RC power comparable to LC power, matching the anomalous data. The resulting computations show that fragmentation is a consistent interpretation for these head echo radar returns.","1944-799X","","10.1029/2011RS004774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776285","","Plasmas;Radar;Numerical models;Signal to noise ratio;Mie scattering;Backscatter","","1","","","","9 Dec 2016","Dec. 2011","","AGU","AGU Journals"
